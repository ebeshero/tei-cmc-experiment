# tei-cmc-experiment
An experiment with preparing and encoding a sampling of the public TEI-listserv archive with TEI Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) 
This repo was made by @ebeshero and shared with @sydb

## About the archive
* The [TEI-L Listserv](https://lists.psu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=TEI-L) begins in 1990 and continues over 3+ decades and multiple university servers (and is continuing)
* The archive is a good way to learn about the history of text formats and character encoding used in e-mail messages from the 1990s onward
* These [ASCII characters not permitted in XML](ASCII_not_in_XML.html) are important in our project because we need to escape them in order to prepare an archive in TEI XML.
* We are attempting to encode the listserv by combining TEI encoding for letter correspondence and CMC (computer-mediated communication).
