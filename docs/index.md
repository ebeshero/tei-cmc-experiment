# tei-cmc-experiment
An experiment with preparing and encoding a sampling of the public TEI-listserv archive with TEI Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) 

## Topics of interest 
* The TEI-L Listserv begins in 1990 and continues over 3+ decades and multiple university servers (and is continuing)
* The archive is a good way to learn about the history of text formats and character encoding used in e-mail messages from the 1990s onward
* These [ASCII characters not permitted in XML](ASCII_not_in_XML.html) are important in our project because we need to escape them in order to prepare an archive in TEI XML.
