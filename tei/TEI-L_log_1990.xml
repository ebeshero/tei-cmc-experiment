               <p>Does anyone have access to <bibl type="standard">ISO 639</bibl>, and would you be willing to
                  summarize the information on language codes?  <bibl type="standard">ISO 639</bibl> bears the
                  title (ca.) <title type="standard">_Codes for the representation of names of languages_</title>,
                  and according to the <orgName>ANSI office</orgName> in <placeName>New York</placeName>, was updated in
                  <date>1988</date>.  I cannot afford the <measure unit="USD"><unit>$</unit><num>37</num></measure> this document costs, and would
                  appreciate help from anyone who has it.  A summary of language
                  codes would probably be worth posting publicly.  I would like to obtain
                  as many codes as possible, but particularly, for languages of
                  antiquity (e.g., <lang>Latin</lang>, <lang>Aramaic</lang>, <lang>Akkadian</lang>; any which have been
                  identified in the ISO) and a fuller list for modern western languages.
                  Note that these two-letter codes are not (always) the same as the
                  country (and postal) codes of <bibl>ISO 3166</bibl> (for example, where Israel
                  would be IL). The language codes known to me currently are as follows:</p>

              <p>MARIO E.B. BALDINI (PSDMSPIN@BRUSPVM) has kindly send a listing of
               language codes from an older version of ISO 639 (_Codes for the

               Spanish (ES, SP) have surfaced, and may reflect versional
               differences in the ISO.  Anyone who has a current version of the

              <p> In the recent exchange of information, I have noted the
               mention of the <bibl>ISO Standard for Language Codes</bibl>.  As
               <roleName>Chairman of the Registration Authority</roleName> for this standard,
               I would be happy to address any specific questions you
               may have regarding the code.</p>
               
              <p> By the way, I should alert you to the fact that this code
               is considered inadequate for bibliographic purposes.
               A working group has been established to draft a
               3-letter code based to the fullest extent possible on
               the <bibl>USMARC code representation</bibl>.  Therefore, I would
               suggest that we not invest effort into investigation
               of the 2-letter code for <orgName>TEI</orgName> purposes.</p>

               <p>About compound documents in <name type="ML">SGML</name> and in the <name type="ML">TEI</name>.  <ref target="#Web-1990-01-31-0933"><persName>R.P. Weber</persName> asked a
                  week ago <q>could someone please explain the <name type="ML">TEI</name> approach to compound
                     documents and images?  WIll <name type="ML">SGML</name> be used here, and if so, how?</q></ref></p>
               
               <p>Apologies for my delay in answering.  I was hoping one of our hypertext
               sages might weigh in with a reply.  (But he appears to have been in the
               <placeName>Caribbean</placeName>, and may not have received the query.)</p>
               
               <p>This problem has not, in fact, been discussed on this server, or as far
               as I'm aware by the working committees.  So the formal answer is that no
               decision has been cast in concrete yet.  Which allows me to turn the
               tables and say <q>How <emph rend="*">should</emph> compound documents be encoded for
               interchange?  What are the requirements?  What are the alternatives?</q></p>
               
              <p>Less formally, I can offer some personal opinions, for what they are
               worth (face value:  two cents -- 2u, for those of you on <objectName>IBM mainframes</objectName>
               with real <objectName>IBM terminals</objectName>).</p>
               
              <p> Certainly <name type="ML">SGML</name> is where we should start in any search for ways of
               handling compound objects, and I don't yet know any reason that SGML
               won't provide a solution for the problem.  I assume there are two
               methods of using <name type="ML">SGML</name> in compound documents (correct me if I'm wrong):
                 (1) use <name type="ML">SGML</name> to organize the compound document (i.e. have an SGML
               document which includes text, images, sound, etc. as its components), or
               (2) use whatever-you-like to organize the compound document as a whole,
               and use <name type="ML">SGML</name> as the notation for the textual components of the compound
               document.</p>
               
               <p>For the simple case of text-with-illustrations, <name type="ML">SGML</name> seems like a viable
               encoding mechanism (for the envelope and for the text components) to me.
               It allows you to encode the graphics however you like, declaring your
               graphics format as a non-<name type="ML">SGML</name> notation and declaring the contents of
               your graphics elements (say 'PICTURE' or 'BLORT') as being data in that
               notation, stored either within the <name type="ML">SGML</name> file or externally to it.  You
               get localization of the graphics within the text stream, integral or
               separate storage of the graphics, and complete freedom to choose
               whatever graphic notation you wish.</p>
               
               <p>As document encoding methods go, <name type="ML">SGML</name> is fairly hospitable to graphics
               and other non-text pieces of compound objects.  Nowhere in the standard
               does it say that the data have to be words and characters.  In fact, as
               far as I know there is no <emph rend="*">explicit</emph> requirement in the standard that an
                  <name type="ML">SGML</name> document even has to be bytes in a computer.  (Sure, it's hard to
               understand the standard any other way, but that's not the same as an
               explicit requirement.)  <bibl>ISO 8879 par. 6.1 note 1</bibl> says in fact <q>This
               International Standard does not constrain the physical organization of
               the document within the data stream, message handling protocol, file
               system, etc., that contains it.</q>  At the <eventName>SGML '89 conference</eventName> last
               <date when="1989-10">October</date> in <placeName>Atlanta</placeName>, there was a very nice paper by <persName>Douglas MacLeod</persName> (read
                  by <persName>Yuri Rubinsky</persName>) thinking about architectural designs as <name type="ML">SGML</name>
                  documents, which led to a general discussion of <name type="ML">SGML</name> definitions for all
               sorts of objects, including automobiles.  Although most people
               (obviously) think of the <name type="ML">SGML</name> document as an electronic <emph rend="*">description</emph> of
               the automobile (and the physical automobile as a side effect of
               processing), it appears, in the light of the passage cited, hard to say
               categorically that an automobile itself could never be parsed as an <name type="ML">SGML</name>
               document.  (If you could figure out how to define the delimiters.)</p>
               
               <p>The only hitch is that the <name type="ML">SGML</name> standard itself (<bibl>ISO 8879</bibl>) does not
                  specify in any detail what the interface between <name type="ML">SGML</name> processors and
                  non-<name type="ML">SGML</name> processors must, may, or can look like -- an advantage, if you
               will, in that it doesn't constrain anyone to an inappropriate model, but
               a bit of a disadvantage in that most people don't have a clue what they
               can now or will eventually or might someday be able to do with SGML and
               graphics processors.</p>
               
               <p>Not being deeply involved in graphics work or compound documents myself,
               I don't know off-hand what options are offered for this sort of thing by
               existing <name type="ML">SGML</name> processors.  There will certainly be a fierce market
               demand for it, not only from humanists but also (to our great advantage)
               from the defense industry, which needs <name type="ML">SGML</name> support for technical
               manuals with diagrams (and of course cross-references and other
               hypertext mechanisms) and has the small change to pay for the
               development costs.  (As long as they don't charge the humanists
               defense-contractor prices!)</p>
               
               <p>If for some reason one does <emph rend="*">not</emph> want to use <name type="ML">SGML</name> as the envelope for
               the entire compound document, then presumably the major requirement for
               the text-components of the compound documents is that they be
               computationally well-behaved, with a clearly defined structure, hooks
               for pointers going out, and hooks for pointers coming in.  SGML
               certainly has all of this, in its document type declarations and its ID
               names and its IDREF pointers.</p>
               
               <p>Perhaps those subscribers to this list who actually work with compound
                  documents and <name type="ML">SGML</name> will be willing to say how they make things work now,
               and how they would like to see things developing in the future.</p>
               
              <p> All this is, I repeat, just personal opinion and shouldn't be taken as
               defining <soCalled>the</soCalled> position of the <orgName>TEI</orgName>.  (Unless, of course, taking as <soCalled>the</soCalled>
               position will help get a discussion started.)</p>
