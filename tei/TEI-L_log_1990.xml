               <p>Does anyone have access to <bibl type="standard">ISO 639</bibl>, and would you be
                  willing to summarize the information on language codes? <bibl type="standard">ISO
                     639</bibl> bears the title (ca.) <title type="standard">_Codes for the
                     representation of names of languages_</title>, and according to the
                     <orgName>ANSI office</orgName> in <placeName>New York</placeName>, was updated
                  in <date>1988</date>. I cannot afford the <measure unit="USD"

                  appreciate help from anyone who has it. A summary of language codes would probably
                  be worth posting publicly. I would like to obtain as many codes as possible, but
                  particularly, for languages of antiquity (e.g., <lang>Latin</lang>,
                     <lang>Aramaic</lang>, <lang>Akkadian</lang>; any which have been identified in
                  the ISO) and a fuller list for modern western languages. Note that these
                  two-letter codes are not (always) the same as the country (and postal) codes of
                     <bibl type="standard">ISO 3166</bibl> (for example, where Israel would be IL).
                  The language codes known to me currently are as follows:</p>

               <p>MARIO E.B. BALDINI (PSDMSPIN@BRUSPVM) has kindly send a listing of language codes
                  from an older version of ISO 639 (_Codes for the representation of names of
                  languages_). Two different codes for Spanish (ES, SP) have surfaced, and may
                  reflect versional differences in the ISO. Anyone who has a current version of the
                  document (1988 revision) is invited to check this list and report and additions or
                  changes.</p>

               <p> In the recent exchange of information, I have noted the mention of the <bibl
                     type="standard">ISO Standard for Language Codes</bibl>. As <roleName>Chairman
                     of the Registration Authority</roleName> for this standard, I would be happy to
                  address any specific questions you may have regarding the code.</p>
               <p> By the way, I should alert you to the fact that this code is considered
                  inadequate for bibliographic purposes. A working group has been established to
                  draft a 3-letter code based to the fullest extent possible on the <bibl>USMARC
                     code representation</bibl>. Therefore, I would suggest that we not invest
                  effort into investigation of the 2-letter code for <orgName>TEI</orgName>
                  purposes.</p>

               <p>About compound documents in <name type="ML">SGML</name> and in the <name type="ML"
                     >TEI</name>. <ref target="#Web-1990-01-31-0933"><persName>R.P. Weber</persName>
                     asked a week ago <q>could someone please explain the <name type="ML">TEI</name>
                        approach to compound documents and images? WIll <name type="ML">SGML</name>
                        be used here, and if so, how?</q></ref></p>
               <p>Apologies for my delay in answering. I was hoping one of our hypertext sages might
                  weigh in with a reply. (But he appears to have been in the
                     <placeName>Caribbean</placeName>, and may not have received the query.)</p>
               <p>This problem has not, in fact, been discussed on this server, or as far as I'm
                  aware by the working committees. So the formal answer is that no decision has been
                  cast in concrete yet. Which allows me to turn the tables and say <q>How <emph
                        rend="*">should</emph> compound documents be encoded for interchange? What
                     are the requirements? What are the alternatives?</q></p>
               <p>Less formally, I can offer some personal opinions, for what they are worth (face
                  value: two cents -- 2u, for those of you on <objectName>IBM
                     mainframes</objectName> with real <objectName>IBM terminals</objectName>).</p>
               <p> Certainly <name type="ML">SGML</name> is where we should start in any search for
                  ways of handling compound objects, and I don't yet know any reason that SGML won't
                  provide a solution for the problem. I assume there are two methods of using <name
                     type="ML">SGML</name> in compound documents (correct me if I'm wrong): (1) use
                     <name type="ML">SGML</name> to organize the compound document (i.e. have an
                  SGML document which includes text, images, sound, etc. as its components), or (2)
                  use whatever-you-like to organize the compound document as a whole, and use <name
                     type="ML">SGML</name> as the notation for the textual components of the
                  compound document.</p>
               <p>For the simple case of text-with-illustrations, <name type="ML">SGML</name> seems
                  like a viable encoding mechanism (for the envelope and for the text components) to
                  me. It allows you to encode the graphics however you like, declaring your graphics
                  format as a non-<name type="ML">SGML</name> notation and declaring the contents of
                  your graphics elements (say 'PICTURE' or 'BLORT') as being data in that notation,
                  stored either within the <name type="ML">SGML</name> file or externally to it. You
                  get localization of the graphics within the text stream, integral or separate
                  storage of the graphics, and complete freedom to choose whatever graphic notation
                  you wish.</p>
               <p>As document encoding methods go, <name type="ML">SGML</name> is fairly hospitable
                  to graphics and other non-text pieces of compound objects. Nowhere in the standard
                  does it say that the data have to be words and characters. In fact, as far as I
                  know there is no <emph rend="*">explicit</emph> requirement in the standard that
                  an <name type="ML">SGML</name> document even has to be bytes in a computer. (Sure,
                  it's hard to understand the standard any other way, but that's not the same as an
                  explicit requirement.) <bibl>ISO 8879 par. 6.1 note 1</bibl> says in fact <q>This
                     International Standard does not constrain the physical organization of the
                     document within the data stream, message handling protocol, file system, etc.,
                     that contains it.</q> At the <eventName>SGML '89 conference</eventName> last
                     <date when="1989-10">October</date> in <placeName>Atlanta</placeName>, there
                  was a very nice paper by <persName>Douglas MacLeod</persName> (read by
                     <persName>Yuri Rubinsky</persName>) thinking about architectural designs as
                     <name type="ML">SGML</name> documents, which led to a general discussion of
                     <name type="ML">SGML</name> definitions for all sorts of objects, including
                  automobiles. Although most people (obviously) think of the <name type="ML"
                     >SGML</name> document as an electronic <emph rend="*">description</emph> of the
                  automobile (and the physical automobile as a side effect of processing), it
                  appears, in the light of the passage cited, hard to say categorically that an
                  automobile itself could never be parsed as an <name type="ML">SGML</name>
                  document. (If you could figure out how to define the delimiters.)</p>
               <p>The only hitch is that the <name type="ML">SGML</name> standard itself (<bibl
                     type="standard">ISO 8879</bibl>) does not specify in any detail what the
                  interface between <name type="ML">SGML</name> processors and non-<name type="ML"
                     >SGML</name> processors must, may, or can look like -- an advantage, if you
                  will, in that it doesn't constrain anyone to an inappropriate model, but a bit of
                  a disadvantage in that most people don't have a clue what they can now or will
                  eventually or might someday be able to do with SGML and graphics processors.</p>
               <p>Not being deeply involved in graphics work or compound documents myself, I don't
                  know off-hand what options are offered for this sort of thing by existing <name
                     type="ML">SGML</name> processors. There will certainly be a fierce market
                  demand for it, not only from humanists but also (to our great advantage) from the
                  defense industry, which needs <name type="ML">SGML</name> support for technical
                  manuals with diagrams (and of course cross-references and other hypertext
                  mechanisms) and has the small change to pay for the development costs. (As long as
                  they don't charge the humanists defense-contractor prices!)</p>
               <p>If for some reason one does <emph rend="*">not</emph> want to use <name type="ML"
                     >SGML</name> as the envelope for the entire compound document, then presumably
                  the major requirement for the text-components of the compound documents is that
                  they be computationally well-behaved, with a clearly defined structure, hooks for
                  pointers going out, and hooks for pointers coming in. SGML certainly has all of
                  this, in its document type declarations and its ID names and its IDREF
                  pointers.</p>
               <p>Perhaps those subscribers to this list who actually work with compound documents
                  and <name type="ML">SGML</name> will be willing to say how they make things work
                  now, and how they would like to see things developing in the future.</p>
               <p> All this is, I repeat, just personal opinion and shouldn't be taken as defining
                     <soCalled>the</soCalled> position of the <orgName>TEI</orgName>. (Unless, of
                  course, taking as <soCalled>the</soCalled> position will help get a discussion
                  started.)</p>

               </dateline>
               <p>I'm working on restoring a text file that was keypunched in the 1960s to complete
                  upper/lower case <name type="charEnc">ASCII</name>. (It currently is ALL UPPER
                  CASE). I would like to `do it right' such that more than just the upper/lower
                  case, italics, accent marks, paragraph, headings are correctly identified. I.e.
                  capitalization seems to me to be a reflection of a deeper semantic reason things
                  are capitalized, such as that they are a particular type of proper noun, name of a
                  person, country, company, etc. Italics likewise reflects roles such as book, play,
                  movie, etc. titles; foreign words, quoted material, emphasis, etc.</p>
               <p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to do such tagging? I.e., if one
                  encounters something such as, <eg>`PRESIDENT KENNEDY TOLD PRIME MINISTER
                     MACMILLIAN ...' and wants to restore the reasons it should be capitalized as ,
                     `President Kennedy told Prime Minister Macmillian...'</eg> (Note: it is
                  Macmillian not MacMillian) what should one do?</p>
               <p> Thus, I can markup the text as, <eg>
                     <!-- 2024-09-29 ebb: I found that <egXML> was not valid here. NOTE: needs a namespace, and it's not really appropriate b/c this XML wouldn't parse. It would be anachronistic to call this XML!  -->
                     &amp;lt;Sentence&amp;gt; &amp;lt;NationLeader country=USA&amp;gt;
                     &amp;lt;Title&amp;gt; President &amp;lt;/Title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LName
                     id=John_F._Kennedy&amp;gt; Kennedy &amp;lt;/LName&amp;gt;
                     &amp;lt;/NationLeader&amp;gt; told &amp;lt;NationLeader country=GB&amp;gt;

                  themselves. Thus the support of <orgName>UIC</orgName>, <orgName>Oxford</orgName>,
                     <orgName>Vassar</orgName>, <orgName>Univ. of Pisa</orgName>,

                     <orgName>Queen's Univ. (Ont.)</orgName>, should be acknowledged, as also that
                  of all the other places whose staff and faculty are serving on working
                  committees.</p>
               <p>Finally, some costs have also been borne by the three sponsoring organizations:

                           <head>INTRODUCTION</head>

                           <p>In this paper I discuss some proposals and partial solutions to the
                              problems of encoding textual parallels, textual variation and related
                              features. Encoding for textual parallels and textual variation will
                              employ SGML-based (and perhaps non-SGML) constructs developed for
                              other encoding problems, both within the domain of TEI-REP and within
                              the TEI ANA group. The two inter-related topics specifically assigned
                              to me under the current TEI-REP work agenda ("textual parallels" and
                              "textual variants") are dependent upon and closely related to the
                              decisions reached on "Reference Systems" (6.7; Mylonas),
                              "Cross-References and Text-Links" (TEI TRR4 6.11; DeRose). Likewise,
                              Johansson's work on "Normalization Practices and Documenting Them"
                              (TEI TRR4 7.2.1) bears similarity to the text-critical issue of
                              machine collation and machine analysis of texts in different
                              languages, scripts, transcription systems, orthographic-strata, etc.
                              Accordingly, I plan to revise the following sections for TEI TRR2
                              6.9-6.10 in light of other decisions and recommendations reached in
                              the Oxford TEI-REP meetings.</p>

                              6.10]</head>

                           <div type="section">
                              <head>A. DEFINITIONS</head>

                              <p>I use the term "(textual) parallels" to refer broadly to any two
                                 documents, or regions of text within the same document, or sets of
                                 documents which literary/linguistic analysts would like to compare
                                 in some way because they share significant degree of structure
                                 and/or content, or perhaps pedigree. The comparison may be
                                 quantitative (e.g., searching for index of term-frequencies or
                                 co-occurrences) or simply visual (e.g.,parallel displays which
                                 support synchronous scrolling of two or more documents).
                                 Provisionally, I think of "textual variants" as a special case of
                                 textual parallelism (though requiring much more annotation) in that
                                 they are parallel textual objects competing for antiquity,
                                 typological priority, authenticity and so forth. The issue of
                                 document versioning is tangent to textual criticism in that both
                                 involve attempts to reconstruct or record exact evolutionary stages
                                 and processes in the composition and transmission of texts. In the
                                 more general case, "textually" variant readings are simply parallel
                                 texts which contribute information to our understanding of the
                                 evolutionary history of an idealized (fictional) literary entity we
                                 think of as a literary "text."</p>

                              <p>Here are some examples of (sub-) documents I would call "parallel"
                                 texts: <list rend="bulleted">

                                       the classic; a quotation and its contextual source</item>

                                    <item>a literary text and its translation (into another

                                    <item>the same text viewed simultaneously in different scripts,

                                       being generated from separate documents or parts of a
                                       database rather than through document filtering]</item>

                                    <item>texts which stem from a common source (eg., the three New

                                       annalistic reports; multiple recensions of the flood epic in
                                       several Mesopotamian languages at several periods; the long
                                       and one-seventh-shorter versions of biblical Jeremiah)</item>

                              <head>B. LEVELS OF GRANULARITY</head>

                              <p>In order to provide encoding for such parallel texts or regions of
                                 texts, the encoder must begin by: (a) determining the level of
                                 granularity at which the text(s) are to be tagged, and (b)
                                 designating names for those textual objects which will be matched
                                 as the parallels (c) devising referencing a scheme which allows one
                                 to unambiguously point to regions of "parallel" text delimited by
                                 the tagging (so that reference may be made to these units from
                                 external sources). The referencing scheme is critical because the
                                 parallels may not involve matched textual objects (e.g., "verses"
                                 in one edition with "verses" in another edition). The parallels may
                                 involve mappings between points and spans, or between spans of text
                                 very unlike in some characteristics.</p>

                              <p>The levels of granularity chosen of course depend upon the
                                 applications. I believe that for representing "parallel" structures
                                 (and "textual") variants, character-level encoding and everything
                                 higher must be supported. Certainly this will be required by
                                 linguists in the TEI ANA group, but we may imagine multiple uses
                                 for character-level encoding for "textual variation" and
                                 "parallels" as well. In text criticism, paleographic annotations at
                                 character level are often given by various typographic conventions.
                                 For example, in Qumran publications there are 4-5 special sigla
                                 attached to characters (usually supralinear attachment) for
                                 indicating whether the characters are of such-and-such varying
                                 degrees of legibility, or suspended characters in a word, etc. In
                                 other cases, uncertain characters are interpreted in terms of a
                                 closed set of alternatives: "b/m" (written in Hebrew script) would
                                 mean "the character beth or mem -- we know it is one or the other,
                                 because and both make sense and are paleographically possible , but
                                 we don't know which letter this is for sure." Or suppose we wish to
                                 study parallel displays in which adjacent orthographic strata are
                                 involved, and we want to see "level n+1" orthographic innovations
                                 in a color-coded scheme (e.g, in historic periods when quiescent
                                 consonants or semi-vowels are being introduced as vocalization
                                 markers). Or a literary critic may wish to selectively tag
                                 consonance or assonance using character-level or syllable-level
                                 annotation.</p>

                              <p>At a higher (sub-word) unit, morpheme-level annotations are also
                                 both necessary for text criticism and parallel analysis. Consider
                                 the case where a German student may be assisted in Greek language
                                 instruction by viewing parallel texts, say an Greek tragedy and a
                                 German translation, or an English student learning Hebrew uses
                                 synchronized parallel displays for Hebrew and English. In either
                                 instance, the student might tab through a sentence in either window
                                 and see equivalent (parallel) terms displayed in reverse video in
                                 both windows. But morpheme-level would be required: the Hebrew
                                 "and/from/his/hellish abode" is written as one "word" (yet four or
                                 more "morphemes," as counted by Hebrew linguists) but as four words
                                 in English, so the color display of the single Hebrew word will
                                 show four color-coded regions matching the similarly color-coded
                                 four separate words in English. And German separable prepositions
                                 will map at morpheme level to single Greek terms. For text-critical
                                 work, variants often involve just differences in person, number,
                                 gender, mood, state (whatever) which are resolved in inflectional
                                 morphemes; since these kinds of variations need to be annotated for
                                 cataloging, it's clear that morpheme-level annotations
                                 (morpheme-level tagging) are necessary. Syllable-level marking and
                                 morpheme-level marking are necessary for making text-critical
                                 comparisons of cuneiform texts, for example, because of mixed
                                 orthographies in various scribal traditions, geographic regions,
                                 etc. (e.g., the neo-Assyrian scribes use far more logographic
                                 (ideographic) spellings with phonetic complements for certain words
                                 than Babylonian scribes copying the same texts with syllabic
                                 writing; for these languages, text critical analysis will require
                                 not only orthographic normalization, but in some cases syllable-
                                 and morpheme level tags. It is easy to recognize, or course, that
                                 linguistic analysis requires morpheme-level annotations, and
                                 probably multiple alternate morphemic representations based upon
                                 varying linguistic theories.</p>

                              <p> I have started with two examples of sub-word granularity for
                                 parallelism because it is not entirely clear that an SGML encoding
                                 should be used for this level of tagging/markup/linking. I have no
                                 personal opinion or preference on this matter. On the authority of
                                 two SGML experts, I am cautioned about two potential concerns: (a)
                                 the amount of overhead involved in SGML tagging at character- and
                                 morpheme-levels is extraordinary -- we can easily get more
                                 meta-data than data, which might be a problem; (b) character-level
                                 tagging using SGML has (apparently) not yet been adequately tested.
                                 Here follows an example of an encoding of one single Hebrew word. I
                                 know it's monstrous: it evoked a gasp of "oy,veh" from a more
                                 qualified member of TEI-REP (I suppose not just because it's so
                                 ugly, and redundant -- fails to use legal minimizations, but also
                                 because there is no DATA here yet except marking of morphemes with
                                 reference id's; I have delimited only one of the 13 characters; I
                                 could have also added "syllableid," which would be useful in text
                                 criticism for cuneiform texts.</p>

                              <p>One obvious criticism of this approach is that much of the encoding
                                 can be generated (e.g., charid's) by a program; so why introduce
                                 this stuff into the text? Why not just let the application handle
                                 it, and use some non-SGML system for referencing? On the hypothesis
                                 that such encoding is at least legal, and help would satisfy our
                                 need for character- and morpheme-level annotations, it remains
                                 unclear to me whether this encoding would actually be useful in
                                 solving the problem of "parallel" and "textually variant" texts. If
                                 character- and morpheme level units tagged with an SGML-based
                                 tagging system cannot be addressed (referenced) with SGML
                                 mechanisms (IDREF, IDREFS) for purposes of synchronization, then
                                 perhaps they are of lesser value; perhaps a non SGML
                                 (applications-level) solution should be proposed. The issue of SGML
                                 based referencing will be discussed more below.</p>

                              <p>Besides the fact that this markup is ugly, redundant, and can in
                                 part be programmatically-generated, there are other criticisms: (a)
                                 current processors will gag and choke; (b) the file now defies the
                                 canon of "human-readable" SGML files. Possible answers to these
                                 objections: (a) "don't let processors (except batch processors
                                 working as filters) look at the monstrosity," or "processors are
                                 getting faster all the time" and; (b) "so what? (give up the myth
                                 of 'human-readable' SGML)."</p>

                              <p>A non-SGML solution which would be well-suited (?) to humans and
                                 computers alike would be to use a standard referencing system down
                                 to verse or line level, then some kind of regular-expression style
                                 "pattern match" to get the offsets. Of course, this is the method
                                 used by human editors and authors in traditional scholarship. We
                                 say, "as reported by Josephus in Antiquities XVI.187,
                                 '(preceding_context) relevant_text (following_context)'
                                 (Loeb/Marcus edition) blah blah..." For use of this convention in
                                 encoding, however, the rules would need to be much more rigorously
                                 defined and enforced (how to qualify second-occurrences of
                                 substrings; how to designate omission of characters/words with
                                 ellipsis). The advantage of this system is that it's instantly
                                 democratized because it's based upon unambiguous rules and
                                 applicable to paper editions as well as electronic editions. A
                                 scholar in a remote part of the world publishing a new text, or
                                 encoding an extant text could cross-reference any other "parallel"
                                 text at any level of granularity without knowing how others
                                 (unbekannt) were encoding those "parallel" texts. From the
                                 machine's point of view, the system is unambiguous and efficient
                                 because it uses character offset in the file. The downside would be
                                 that character-offsets (in machine languages) are vulnerable when
                                 files are changed in minor ways, and methods for updating
                                 offsets/indices or redundancy checks would place another burden on
                                 the application.</p>

                              <p>More will be said below about the kinds of annotations which need
                                 to be attached at character- morpheme- word- arbitrary_string- and
                                 other (linguistic) levels for encoding textual variation. Since
                                 parallel texts are just declared to be "matched" (but not HOW), the
                                 situation is easier. For the purpose of synchronizing textual
                                 regions for parallel display or analysis, the primary concern is
                                 whether/how the SGML-based encoding can be used, in connection with
                                 other factors, to help drive these applications. Some of the "other
                                 factors" will now be discussed. Most of these issues were discussed
                                 at length in my earlier TEI-REP paper (TEI TRW2, available in 2
                                 parts on the UICVM listserver as TRW2PT1 SCRIPT and TRW2PT2

                              <p>Two general approaches for synchronization are obvious; in our
                                 CDWord hypertext project, we have used the first method: (1) one
                                 may place structure markers from text A as empty tags into all
                                 other documents which need to be set in synchrony with text A
                                 (multiple binary mappings), and, (2) one may place
                                 artificially-devised "canonical" reference markers in all texts,
                                 with the help of ancillary tables which help resolve anomalous
                                 situations relative to the canonical standard text.
                                 Synchronizations may then be made between the artificial scheme and
                                 the individual referencing schemes used in traditional scholarship
                                 (incongruent systems being resolved at this level). Whether either
                                 of these method is ideal, and how either would be best implemented
                                 with an SGML-based language I will defer to others. Perhaps there
                                 are far better systems. I have some skepticism about both methods,
                                 based on difficulties we have encountered. Against the first
                                 method: (a) the amount of overhead in meta-data will become
                                 burdensome for texts which are heavily cross-referenced, and (with
                                 CONCUR?) seems to imply multiple or overfull DTD's; (b) it fails to
                                 exploit the usefulness of currently existing canonical referencing
                                 schemes; (c) it may (?? -- not sure) not support the need to see
                                 different sections of the same document in parallel. However, in
                                 favor of the first method (multiple binary mappings) is that some
                                 synchronizations, especially those at a very low level of
                                 granularity, appear to be required at binary level. Imagine, for
                                 example, trying to map a dozen versions or translations of the
                                 Bible onto a common "canonical" scheme, based upon unique (SGML)
                                 id's for each morpheme in each version, with an ultimate goal of
                                 supporting color-coded "parallels" at morpheme level between any
                                 two versions or all versions. Binary mappings at this level appear
                                 feasible (though labor intensive), but multiple synchronizations
                                 via a single canonically scheme seems hard. Maybe it would work,
                                 but I have some doubts (general linguists: please speak up).
                                 Multiple binary mappings sounds like a lot of work, but currently
                                 the CATSS project at the University of Pennsylvania/Hebrew
                                 University, and the Fils d'Abraham Project (Maredsous) are making
                                 binary mappings between Bible versions, apparently with
                                 satisfactory results. At a higher level of granularity (e.g.
                                 biblical "verse" level), using an idealized general referencing
                                 system may be feasible; it works tolerably well in our CDWord
                                 project for the purpose of visually aligning (synchronous
                                 scrolling) biblical texts, translations, commentaries and other
                                 "canonically-structured" documents in parallel displays.</p>

                              <p>I do not know whether there may be more optimal SGML or non-SGML
                                 solutions to the referencing problem which avoid cluttering the
                                 text with unique id markers. I feel confident that other members on
                                 the TEI-REP subcommittee (those with professional training in
                                 formal language theory) will have valuable judgments about these
                                 markup issues; I cannot promote other than the general options I
                                 see on the surface. In response to a query, Steve DeRose briefly
                                 suggested using an open-ended canonical scheme with integers or
                                 whole numbers; presumably Steve (section 6.11, "Cross-References
                                 and Text-Links") and Elli Mylonas (section 6.7, "Reference
                                 Systems") David Durand will offer better presentations of the
                                 options.</p>

                              <p>I do feel it would be wise to communicate with the TEI-ANA group
                                 about their solution(s) to the problem of character- and
                                 morpheme-level annotations. The encoding of text-linguistic
                                 features with character level and morpheme-level annotations is
                                 inevitable: how does TEI-ANA propose to deal with id-markers?
                                 Another concern parallel to that of TEI-ANA is that in some
                                 textual-critical arenas (as with linguistic/literary annotations),
                                 the volume of text-critical annotation will become immense: where
                                 shall these annotations be located in the SGML file? It may become
                                 increasingly distasteful (to some??) to envision text-critical
                                 encoding (kilobytes per "word" in some cases) inter lineated with
                                 "the text." It may be that "the text" should be kept free both of
                                 id markers and text-critical annotations (placing this information
                                 elsewhere in the document) so that our processors can (directly)
                                 read "the text" in real-time. Others might argue that the encoding
                                 is not meant to be used by applications directly (but only as
                                 data/document interchange), so never mind if the "words" of "the
                                 text" are separated by a 100,000 characters of meta-data and
                                 annotation-data in the flat file. I have no opinion, except that I
                                 would like to purchase affordable SGML software for my 386-class
                                 machine and not have it choke on my data.</p>

                              6.9]</head>

                              <p>I suggested above that "textual variants" may be viewed as special
                                 cases of "textual parallels," though more complicated parallels.
                                 Such a view is the more reasonable if we believe that talking about
                                 a textual problem in a textual commentary (referring to the core
                                 data of lemma, variants and witnesses) or from any EXTERNAL locus
                                 is just as important as viewing textual variation from within a
                                 given document (the that document's "lemma" as over against
                                 readings of other witnesses cited only by their sigla). I think the
                                 former is the proper (or optimal) way to conceptualize "textual
                                 variation" anyway, but incline even more strongly to it for
                                 pragmatic reasons. Textual parallels may be thought of as immediate
                                 candidates for hypertext even if the taxonomy of links (link types)
                                 is underdeveloped. We simply declare that loci A and B and C (where
                                 A, B, C may be points, spans, or discontinuous spans) are
                                 equivalent in some way, and let the application handle the
                                 expression of those links. For encoding textual variation, the
                                 taxonomy of links must (usually) be much richer: texts A, B, and C
                                 are not just formally equivalent, but they are related in very
                                 specific ways. The complex network of inter-dependencies between
                                 parallel objects is one important factor in making the encoding of
                                 textual variation more demanding. I would be interested in the
                                 judgments of others about the relevance of hypertext (link types)
                                 to textual criticism; the paper of Steve DeRose ("Expanding the
                                 Notion of Links," Hypertext 1989 Conference) is suggestive, but I
                                 have been unable to talk to him about this in detail.</p>

                              <p>Based upon exchanges with other scholars interested in textual
                                 variation, I sense that each one's formulation of a model for
                                 encoding textual variation will strongly reflect the particular
                                 field of textual studies (modern literature? epigraphic texts?
                                 ancient texts?), the adequacy of printed critical editions in the
                                 field, and the particular text-critical theories each one embraces.
                                 These biases probably cannot be escaped, nor are they necessarily
                                 bad. I would suggest that for TEI encoding "standards"
                                 (recommendations) to be accepted in humanities areas, it will be
                                 necessary to create user manuals highly specific to sub- specialty
                                 areas. Scholarly needs and goals may be very different in specific
                                 areas, and the domain-experts in each literary field should be
                                 assisted in the refinement of prioritized goals in which encoding
                                 of text-critically-relevant information will play an important
                                 role. In some fields, standard editions may contain evidence from
                                 manuscripts that are badly and incompletely collated, so that
                                 encoding through programmatic re-collation would be an optimal
                                 effort. In other fields, the most fruitful historical results may
                                 come from intense study of scribal ductus and manuscript
                                 paleography which has hitherto been inadequately investigated.
                                 Other fields may be blessed with superb critical editions in which
                                 the encoding of critical apparatuses alone may yield a rich,
                                 complete text-critical database. The "manuals" for "encoding
                                 textual variants" should therefore reflect the variable situations
                                 and priorities in our respective literary fields. At the same time,
                                 I feel it would be wise to develop as general a model as possible
                                 for the encoding of information germane to the text-critical
                                 enterprise. We may accept this on the strength of the obvious
                                 assumption that for standards-purposes, general solutions are
                                 better than dedicated solutions (e.g., solutions which are matched
                                 to current applications, or lack of applications).</p>

                              <head>B. THE GOALS OF ENCODING TEXT-CRITICAL DATA</head>

                              <p> My assignment in TEI TRR4 (6.9) is specified as providing
                                 assistance on encoding of the "Critical Apparatus." Textual
                                 apparatuses have been used in printed books for several centuries,
                                 so the critical apparatus is undeniably an issue of concern for
                                 TEI-REP. In my earlier TEI-REP paper (TEI TRW2, "Factor 2), I
                                 outlined several reasons why I (nevertheless) felt that a focus
                                 upon the "Critical Apparatus" was not the best approach to modeling
                                 the encoding of textual variation and textual transmission.</p>

                              <p>If the goal of the TEI-REP encoding recommendations is to provide
                                 mechanisms for the encoding of critical apparatuses
                                 &lt;emp&gt;exactly as they appear in printed manuscripts and
                                 editions&lt;/&gt;, then we are faced with a broad task of surveying
                                 all kinds of critical apparatuses used in world literature
                                 (something I have been unable to do). But volumes I have access to
                                 employ significantly different conventions in critical apparatus
                                 (some of which, like the "score" or /Paritur-Umschrift/, could
                                 possibly be handled as textual parallels; see TEI TRW2 "Factor 7,"
                                 final paragraph). If the goal is to provide mechanisms for encoding
                                 text critical information in critical apparatuses within a new
                                 standard sub document type (which represents the "best" traditions
                                 of critical apparatuses, e.g., in the Oxford critical editions),
                                 then the task is easier. If the goal is to provide general
                                 mechanisms for recording knowledge/information germane to textual
                                 composition, textual evolution, recension and transmission, then we
                                 must determine whether and how optimally the encoding of the
                                 critical apparatus contributes to that process, and how to encode
                                 analysis &lt;emp&gt;not&lt;/&gt; contained within the traditional
                                 critical apparatus. In any case, the goal involves more than the
                                 simply the "markup" of a single document: it involves the encoding
                                 of complex relationships between elements of many documents. The
                                 analysis involved in the taxonomy of relationships appears to me
                                 tangent to the forms of literary and linguistic analysis being
                                 developed in the TEI-ANA group.</p>

                              <p> I briefly outline my recommendation here. I believe it is more
                                 important to focus on encoding KNOWLEDGE about textual readings and
                                 textual evolution (e.g., information which is traditionally
                                 contained in separate volumes or sections of textual commentary),
                                 with a view to the creation of a text-critical database. Much of
                                 this knowledge is not, traditionally, information coded in critical
                                 apparatuses: the fact that it &lt;emp&gt;could be&lt;/&gt; is less
                                 relevant than the fact that it &lt;emp&gt;is not&lt;/&gt; for
                                 discernible reasons. My perspective is that data/knowledge about
                                 textual variants and textual evolution is parallel to the matter of
                                 (encoded) linguistic annotations, which contribute to lexicons,
                                 grammars, corpus-linguistics databases and other linguistic tools.
                                 Thus, many of the critical editions I own have separate sections or
                                 associated companion volumes containing textual commentary:
                                 additional tables and lists of examples of orthographic practices,
                                 dialectical features, scribal proclivities, tell-tale recensional
                                 data, etc. Such data would be far more valuable if included as part
                                 of the text-critical database (enriched even more because
                                 &lt;emp&gt;exhaustive&lt;/&gt; lists and tables, based upon
                                 annotations, could then be generated). In cases where text
                                 critical, philological other literary-critical data are mixed in
                                 the same commentary, it may be adequate or preferable to link (via
                                 our "textual parallel" mechanism) the text or textual apparatus to
                                 the commentary. On balance, I still judge that much of the
                                 information in question is most useful in a database, and that
                                 "critical apparatus" and "textual commentary" should not simply be
                                 encoded as separate subdocuments.</p>

                              <p> In light of several exchanges with Michael Sperberg-McQueen, I am
                                 prepared to believe that my perspective arises from experience with
                                 ancient oriental (especially, biblical) texts, and that it may be
                                 unrepresentative of the scholarly interests and goals in a majority
                                 of literary fields. For this reason, I relegate to the Appendix
                                 some additional arguments and illustrative data on this point, but
                                 I do not ask that everyone read them. In attempting to represent
                                 the interests of SBL/AOS/ASOR, I do feel it is necessary to
                                 document these concerns (which may be more germane to TEI cycle
                                 two).</p>

                              <p>Here follows a (preliminary) list of features which I recommend be
                                 considered as standard (where applicable) for an enriched encoding
                                 scheme -- encoding which would be destined for a database, from
                                 which improved critical apparatuses may be printed, including
                                 expression-driven user specified critical apparatuses. For this
                                 purpose, I accept that we may differentiate "lemma" and
                                 "alternative readings," though it is unclear from a database point
                                 of view why a "lemma" deserves a privileged place or that its
                                 features would be any different than those of alternative readings.
                                 The distinction is useful in that traditional critical apparatuses
                                 often do represent "lemma" and "alternative readings" in different
                                 ways. Obviously, many of these features will pertain only to
                                 textual arenas where multiple languages and long traditions are
                                 involved (e.g., most sacred texts and other religious literature).
                                 This first list is a prosaic description of the most important
                                 desiderata, but it is followed by a list of features in more formal
                                 terms. <list rend="numbered">

                                       Variant readings may usefully be grouped together "in
                                       support" of a certain textual alternative reading, and
                                       especially, with implied or explicit top-level normalization
                                       for readings in various languages. However, this grouping
                                       should not be at the expense of other important underlying
                                       information, including the listing of
                                       &lt;emp&gt;actual&lt;/&gt; witnesses or at the expense of
                                       obscuring other details. They should not be grouped together
                                       unless every other relevant attribute (other than witness-id
                                       and textual_locus) is identical &lt;emp&gt;or&lt;/&gt; unless

                                       partial) readings, etc.). If groupings of dissimilar
                                       witnesses are needed for convenience (as in the Goettingen
                                       LXX, for example), then a mechanism for viewing the
                                       underlying individual readings should be supported.</item>

                                       electronic format) should be provided; such information will
                                       also be useful for machines when the texts of the alternative

                                       schemes. While the (app crit's) containing document will
                                       presumably contain these declarations in the DTD, relevant
                                       information about the alternative readings must be supplied
                                       in the encoding of the variants. This requirement also
                                       applies equally to scholarly emendations offered as part of
                                       textual reconstructions, restorations or as is primitive

                                       the alternative readings -- Readings frequently vary in
                                       predictable (but text-critically important) ways: grammatical
                                       concord, scribal hyper-correction at other linguistic levels.
                                       The linguistic annotations on the readings (lemma and
                                       variands) will bear on their interpretation and frequently be
                                       useful in classification of the reading for machine-collation
                                       &amp; quantitative analysis. </item>

                                       and in cases where manuscript collation is used to verify
                                       readings. These notations would register information about
                                       restored readings, character-level annotations about degree
                                       of legibility, alternative paleographic interpretations,
                                       erasures, corrections, marginal supralinear, sublinear
                                       (interlinear) readings, etc.</item>

                                       when the readings can obviously be recognized as derivative
                                       from typologically-antecedent readings, or when some readings
                                       are (translations) in derivative languages, and so forth.
                                       More subtle evidence of genetic/stemmatic relationships may
                                       be shown by collation programs, of course; I envision here
                                       some standard kinds of dependencies (variously applicable to
                                       different textual arenas).</item>

                                       alternative reading is usually implied in a standard critical
                                       apparatus, but it may be necessary or desirable to make this
                                       representation explicit to allows machine collation of all
                                       the readings together, or to allow linguists to make use of
                                       the text-critical database. (Perhaps this could always be
                                       inferred from elements and the associated attribute lists,
                                       but I'm not sure.) </item>

                                       even an inappropriate concession, to non-specialists. I feel
                                       it can be justified, and should be encouraged, to assist

                                       Examples (will vary across fields): the reading represents
                                       expansion, euphemistic rendering, paleographic confusion,
                                       dittography, haplography, aural error, rendering based upon
                                       homographic root (polysemy), (hyper-) etymological
                                       translation, midrashic paraphrase, misplaced
                                       marginal/supralinear gloss, modernizing, secondary
                                       grammatical adjustment, other conflation, etc. I confess that
                                       some standard sigla make sense only on the convention that
                                       each witness (as a published, encoded document) has its own
                                       "lemma" as over against the rest of the universe's
                                       "alternative readings" (e.g., "textual plus," "textual
                                       minus," "different word order"), and these would have to be
                                       converted or interpreted when moving the annotations to a

                           <p>I have only begun to work out some details in terms of an SGML-based
                              encoding scheme. I am increasingly pushed in the direction of this
                              recommendation: that we provide basic guidelines, and examples (in a
                              manual) but assume that the details of the feature list, including the
                              designations of elements, attributes and nestings, will need to be
                              filled out by domain experts in various fields of literature. Two
                              other conclusions are clear: (a) the "standard" template, somewhat
                              like a bibliographic template, will involve many optional features;
                              (b) the templates will be sometimes very complicated, with multiple
                              levels of inter-dependencies; they will involve discipline-specific or
                              language specific mechanisms for expressing the
                              inter-dependencies.</p>

                           <p>It's often not clear to me whether to suggest elements or attributes
                              for some features, so I welcome comments from other TEI-REP members
                              and from the meta-language experts. The following crude scheme
                              reflects a desire to be able to reference a text-critical situation
                              from outside the text (from a commentary or the database point of
                              view), and thus envisions an external referencing mechanism for both
                              "lemma" and "alternative reading." It would be helpful to use the same
                              general structure whether from the standpoint of internal or external
                              referencing. The two objects seem to be the same textual objects
                              except that some essential information about the lemma is
                              automatically inherited from the document DTD which needs to be
                              supplied for the alternative readings. I do not intend these names to
                              be taken seriously, but as provisional handles that are clear.</p>

                           <p>I do not have a strong opinion whether this text-critical information
                              should normally be held at the close-tag of the text_locus or in some
                              other file (sub-document) which is merged with the "text" prior to
                              processing, or in some completely separate document (linked to the
                              lemma containing document via (non-?) SGML link mechanisms. In any
                              case the precise SGML expression of the file would just be a flattened
                              out form once we decide which are tags and which are attributes. If a
                              document has sparse, sporadic text-critical annotation, there would be
                              nothing wrong with putting the data at the text_locus. I think I
                              prefer the notion of holding text-critical data in a separate file if
                              the amount of annotation is massive (more efficient use of processing
                              using buffers?).</p>

                           <p>I may bring to Oxford some refinements/improvements on the above
                              scheme, and welcome alternative proposals from others. Perhaps a
                              couple examples. Michael has sent me a sample text with variants (with
                              full DTD's) based upon SGML-ized EDMACS; I do not include it here, but
                              hope Michael (and perhaps Dominik) will bring these samples and
                              proposals. I especially solicit comments from Professor Ott. I hope
                              also to hear from Professors Thaller and Huitfeldt in Oxford (who are
                              reported to have schemes for encoding textual variation), and I have
                              yet to analyze a sample of marked text from Bob Kraft. I look forward
                              to seeing the detailed work of Peter Robinson (Hockey/Burnard) in
                              connection with COLLATE and OCP productions using SGML for textual
                              variation. Overall, I feel that the referencing scheme is the hardest
                              part. The taxonomies for inter-dependencies can be worked out by
                              domain experts, and we should be able to settle on the core
                              terms/structures in Oxford. The motivation for a highly detailed and
                              rich (but constrained) set of text-critical annotations, obviously, is
                              in support of the richness of the database. I look to Lou Burnard for
                              recommendations on database.</p>

                        <p>The following sections of Appendix attempt to explain why I feel that a
                           focus on the traditional "critical apparatus" is, at least in some
                           textual arenas, less appropriate for encoding than a focus upon the total
                           available body of text-critical knowledge. I admit the probability that
                           this evaluation and its significance are of less moment in some literary
                           fields than in others. The appendix has three parts: <list>

                              BETTER FOCUS FOR ENCODING THAN THE "CRITICAL APPARATUS" (REWORKED
                              HUMANIST POSTING)</head>

                           <p> I feel a lot of work remains to be done before we are prepared to
                              assess how we may best represent knowledge about "textual variation"
                              (textual evolution, textual parallels) using SGML markup languages or
                              other "portable" formalisms. In the simplest textual arenas, or in the
                              event that someone wishes to represent in electronic format JUST what
                              is visible on a printed page of a critical edition, the challenge may
                              not be too difficult. Indeed, several schemes are currently in use by
                              scholarly editing and text-processing systems which can be expressed
                              in an SGML language. By "simple" textual arenas, I refer to: (a) cases
                              in which all textual witnesses are written in the same language and
                              the same "scripts" (= one level within a stratified orthographic
                              system); (b) cases in which the witnesses can be seen in close
                              genetic/stemmatic relationship, not as products of complex textual
                              evolution through heavy recensional/editorial activity; (c) cases in
                              which the number of witnesses and amount of necessary textual
                              commentary represents a small body of information; (d) cases in which
                              one is not concerned about paleographic information and other
                              character-level annotations or codicolgical information. In such
                              cases, the traditional critical apparatus serves literary scholarship
                              very well (the apparatus-region offers enough space for unambiguous
                              presentation of the information), and the SGML-ish representations are
                              fairly straight-forward. </p>
                           <p>But I think the assumptions above may not pertain to the work of a
                              significant number of humanities scholars. The goal of encoding "JUST
                              what is visible on a printed page" (a traditional apparatus criticus,
                              for example) might constitute an important and economical step in the
                              creation of a text-critical database, if assumptions (b) and (c) and
                              (d) were also germane. But when the textual data and published
                              knowledge about that "textual" data become very rich, the standard
                              critical apparatus represents (increasingly) a concession to the
                              limitations of the traditional paper medium: both physical space (the
                              amount of selectivity and condensation) and the ability of a reader to
                              absorb (synthesize, evaluate) large amounts of textual information in
                              complex relationships. In these more complex situations (biblical
                              studies, for example), the paper app crit will contain a selection of
                              data, not all the data (excluding orthographic variants, for instance,
                              which may be important for historical linguistics); it will indicate
                              THAT a certain manuscript or manuscript tradition bears testimony to a
                              certain reading, but will not indicate the steps of principled
                              evaluation which were used to make this judgment (language
                              retroversions, for example); it will tell you THAT a certain
                              manuscript tradition (e.g., "Syriac/Ethiopic/Arabic/Aramaic/Coptic" in
                              support of a certain variant of the Hebrew Bible) supports a given
                              reading, but not which manuscripts exactly, or where, precisely
                              (machine-readable terms) these Syriac/Ethiopic/Arabic/Aramaic/Coptic
                              readings may be found, or what expressions are actually used there.
                              Similarly, some editors (at some periods) were narrowly focused on
                              particular aspects of textual history, textual variation and textual
                              evolution, and systematically ignored the "irrelevant" and "trivial"
                              variations which contributed nothing to their own interests. Searches
                              for texts of highest antiquity or authenticity, for example, have
                              often been given prominent and full representation in critical
                              apparatuses: this priority serves well the interests of certain kinds
                              of historical inquiry (search for the Urtext), but ignores data which
                              are valuable for understanding later traditions which inadvertently or
                              consciously "corrupted" the texts, perhaps for liturgical
                              purposes.</p>

                           <p>It is my opinion, then, that to model the "electronic critical
                              editions" of the 21st century after paper editions would, in some
                              cases, represent a short-sighted goal. We no longer have to exclude
                              "minor" (sic!) orthographic variants (essential for some forms of
                              historical or comparative linguistics) from the databank just because
                              they would render a traditional app crit "unreadable" from the
                              perspective of scholars disinterested in orthography. Rather than just
                              "encoding" or "marking up" modern critical editions (a necessary or
                              desirable step, perhaps), we need to think rather about representation
                              of the knowledge about textual variation, held in critical editions,
                              to be sure, but also in textual commentaries and in fully-encoded
                              manuscripts (tablets, shards, lapidary inscriptions, papyri or other
                              primary documents) which themselves constitute the primary data. In
                              short: we need the encoding of ALL the human knowledge about physical
                              texts, textual "variants" AND the scholarly judgments about processes
                              of textual evolution. "Hypertext" and "SGML-based" encoding can then
                              be put to work in applications software which allows us to study the
                              text with multiple views, even hypothetical documents created with the
                              aid of an SQL/FQL and the text critical database. We may then dispense
                              with the static (sometimes overly selective, sometimes overfull,
                              sometimes inaccurate) app crits and instead enjoy dynamic
                              user-specified app crits containing particular classes of
                              text-critical information we wish to see at a given moment; we may
                              have several different app-crits on the screen, simultaneously. We
                              will be able to do simulations and test hypotheses by dynamically
                              querying hypothetical texts reconstructed from an FQL expression.</p>

                           <p>It is also my judgment that we are quite a distance away from knowing
                              how to encode knowledge about textual relationships in which inter
                              dependencies are complex ("variants," recensions, parallels,
                              allusions, quotations, evolutionary factors, hermeneutical-
                              translational factors). But I think SGML embodies one indispensable
                              ingredient in getting there: encouraging us to assign unique names to
                              objects in our textual universe, and to other properties of text and
                              textual relationships. Our conceptions about these textual (literary,
                              linguistic) objects will inevitably prove to be crude approximations,
                              but by coding our current understanding about them in syntactically-
                              rigorous ways (using SGML based languages), we at least contribute to
                              a legacy of preserving the text and our understanding of it. This
                              conception of encoding that is self-documenting represents an advance
                              upon the less thoughtful processes of antiquity (and in some modern
                              conceptions of text), which were usually self-destructing. </p>

                           <head>A-2. A SUMMARY OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE APPRAISALS OF THE
                              TRADITIONAL CRITICAL APPARATUS </head>
                           <p>If the reader fails to feel any relevance of the tension I have
                              articulated above, it may be because the traditional "critical
                              apparatus" serves varying fields more or less well. I will promote
                              here the argument (should be, "hypothesis") that generally speaking,
                              the adequacy of a critical apparatus (*adequacy conceived in MODERN
                              terms*) will be inversely proportional to the mass and complexity of
                              relevant textual data. Here is an amazing situation: I have before me
                              open copies of six critical editions (gathered off my shelves at
                              random)... <list rend="bulleted">
                                 <item>Hesiod's Theogony (Oxford/Clarendon, 1966/1982)</item>

                              </list> ... and each of the six critical editions contains about the
                              same proportion of "critical apparatus" to "text" per page, though the
                              Greek NT and Targum have slightly higher proportion of apparatus. Does
                              this mean fortune has preserved for us an equivalent wealth of textual
                              evidence for inclusion in these critical apparatuses? Hardly. It means
                              that the scholarly convention called the "critical" edition typically
                              contains pages in which "text" makes up 1/2 - 3/4 of the page, usually
                              at the top, and the remainder of the page is free for "critical
                              apparatus." If the two Bibles included a level of textual detail
                              (data/perspicuity) and percentage of associated relevant facts
                              equivalent to that contained in the Hesiod and Assurbanipal volumes,
                              no human would be able to lift the book. We may also reflect on the
                              fact that most of these volumes, as with most critical editions of
                              literary texts, contain separate sections or companion volumes of
                              textual commentary: why separate sections or companion volumes?</p>

                           <p>Why separate sections in a critical edition volume, or companion
                              volume, for textual commentary -- when the same subject matter is
                              covered? Because the traditional critical apparatus is, at the same
                              moment, both a useful and feeble (paper) convention. I qualify "paper"
                              because in the age of hypertext we are no longer bound by some of the
                              debilitating features of linear text on paper, and the textual
                              commentary supplies one nice example. Positively: The critical
                              apparatus is a powerful and useful scholarly convention, and (I
                              suspect) will continue to be so for the future, even when reproduced
                              on the computer display in character-for-character mimicry of the
                              paper apparatus. We feel sure that encoding of text-critical
                              information will enable scholars to electronically produce far more
                              complete, accurate and informative critical apparatuses than in the
                              past, whether for paper distribution or for use in programs. For
                              textual traditions containing fewer than a dozen witnesses, the app
                              crit may contain exhaustive inventory of textual variants (fully
                              spelled out), including "mere" orthographic variants. For textual
                              traditions with a wealth of evolutionary history, the app crit
                              supplies an essential, digestible overview or summary of the "most
                              important" text-critical issues.</p>

                           <p>Negatively: and negatively in direct proportion to the wealth of
                              textual tradition, the app crit is a feeble instrument in that it only
                              provides a "summary" or "overview" of the textual issues that are most
                              important in the editor's personal judgment. The fact that the textual
                              commentary is isolated in a separate section, or in a companion
                              volume, is a concession to this problem of linear (paper) text.
                              Hypertext offers the power to zoom up-and-down through our choice of
                              detail, at any layer; the textual commentary need not be tucked away
                              somewhere else, and the data of the apparatus need not be an
                              "overview" unless we choose that format. The syntax of the apparatus
                              need not be cryptic and ambiguous (as is often the case in my field --
                              though this should not be tolerated). To the delight of many younger
                              inter-disciplinary scholars, the language of the apparatus need not be
                              Latin (ahem...where the scholarly world of humanities seems intent on
                              outdoing the evil of the medieval Church in keeping certain
                              information...); the app crit may be in EVERY language, if
                              desirable.</p>

                           <p> Consider, for example, that the app crit of the Hebrew Bible
                              (mentioned in the group above) frequently cites among its witnesses
                              the "Greek." But in traditional terms (conventional amount of space
                              allotted to the app crit), this "citation" can never be more than a
                              pointer to the eclectic critical edition of the Greek text, which
                              lives in some 18 separate volumes (still incomplete in the standard
                              Goettingen LXX), which in turn is built up through the investigation
                              of its Greek witnesses and daughter versions (Armenian, Arabic,
                              Ethiopic, Coptic, Syriac, etc.) each of which have their own critical
                              editions. Hypertext will allow us to traverse this path, if the exact
                              paths are charted (rather than citing sigla of "traditions alluded
                              to"), but gaining access to this data will not fit (sensibly) within
                              the traditional conception of a critical apparatus. A traditional
                              critical apparatus must be "manageable," and not take up more than a
                              certain acceptable percentage of the page, and one must be able to
                              peruse it for a synthetic view. Or consider again, when a textual note
                              in the Hebrew Bible says "&amp;gothicQ + mult vrb" it means, "go look
                              for a Qumran manuscript containing a reading relevant to this textual
                              locus, and you'll see it adds lots of additional words." The editor's
                              failure to cite the words may indicate that he thinks they are
                              secondary, or it may indicate that the three additional sentences of
                              Hebrew will not fit on the page. We may fault the editor for not being
                              more specific, (or the editorial board for wanting to print the Henrew
                              Bible in one volume) but within the constraints of the apparatus
                              space, there may indeed not be room for giving the Qumran reading.
                              There is not space for giving dozens of other interesting
                              variants.</p>

                           <p>In short, the negative features of the app crit (even if these are not
                              theoretically-necessary negatives) disappear with cheap/compact
                              electronic storage and non-sequential access to the textual databank.
                              The principle of selectivity in a critical apparatus (or for any
                              encoded, annotated text) is essential, but the question is: WHOSE
                              power to select? In a fully marked text (all manuscripts,
                              text-critical annotations, linguistic annotations, bibliographic
                              annotations, literary-critical annotations), 99% of what's "in" the
                              text will be garbage at any one moment. The power of selectivity needs
                              to be handed to the user. Scholars who are forced to work with
                              inadequate critical editions should not be encouraged to "encode"
                              those critical editions; they should be given guidelines and tools
                              which make possible the encoding of information, ultimately designed
                              for a (relational?) database, from which they can create their own
                              critical apparatuses and make queries of the sort that
                              critical-apparatuses were never intended to answer.</p>

                           <head>A-3. A WORKED EXAMPLE FROM THE STANDARD CRITICAL EDITION OF THE
                              HEBREW BIBLE</head>

                           <p>Here follows an example of the deficiency of critical apparatus in
                              cases where the principle of selectivity and pressure for brevity work
                              decidedly against the usefulness of the apparatus. Two rebuttals could
                              be offered (by anyone patient enough to read this example): "it's an
                              isolated, unrepresentative and extreme example," and "the editor
                              should be shot." Neither are fair: I can find far worse examples
                              (which I sometimes use in instructing students that ad fontes does not
                              mean the critical apparatus!); and the editors were working under
                              hopelessly unrealistic constraints: "(something like) the critical
                              apparatus shall consume no more that 2 vertical inches at the bottom
                              of the page..." </p>
                           <p>The standard edition of the Hebrew Bible (BHS) offers four textual
                              notes on Deuteronomy 32:8, where the text reads (according to the
                              translated Hebrew BHS text): </p>
                           <ab>When the Most High (Elyon) gave the nations their patrimony <lb/>When
                              he made a division for the sons of men <lb/>He established the
                              territories/boundaries of the people <lb/>According to the number of
                              the sons of Israel. </ab>
                           <p>The fourth textual note on this verse in the BHS apparatus concerns
                              the expression "sons of Isreal." It's tough using IRV characters to
                              indicate what's happening here, but I will try in successive stages:
                              (1) to represent the textual note (2) to explain what's meant by the
                              textual note (3) to explain what's missing and wrong and inadequate
                              from the perspective of a machine-readable version.</p>

                           <ab type="example">(3) WHAT'S INADEQUATE/WRONG ABOUT THE READING FROM A
                              MACHINE'S POINT OF VIEW? <ab> (a) The convention of mapping the
                                 textual note to the text string with "superscript d-d" works just
                                 fine for humans, but is not a legal SGML representation. If we wish
                                 to place such textual data in the flat file loc cit, a number of
                                 possibilities are open: flag the lemma at both ends with
                                 &lt;textual_variant&gt;....&lt;/&gt; or whatever. I question
                                 whether we want to do this, since in some cases there will be
                                 literally pages of "textual_variant" data for each of several words
                                 in a sentence. An alternative is to find a qualified referencing
                                 system (perhaps using id's and refid's), and to hold text-critical
                                 data in a separate file. Note that when giving the Hebrew lemma, a
                                 third orthographic stratum (different from the two in the app crit)
                                 must be used as a language (script?) qualifier: the main text
                                 contains cantillation marks as well as consonants, matres and
                                 vowels. The application software will have to be smart enough to
                                 convert readings from one orthographic stratum to another in order
                                 to make comparisons. </ab>
                              <ab>(b) The siglum &amp;gothicQ for "Qumran" is meant for a humans. It
                                 means that somewhere, sometime a manuscript was found in one of the
                                 Qumran (Dead Sea) caves which bears some relationship (yet to be
                                 made clear) to this text. But which cave? Which manuscript? Where
                                 was it published? Plate number? Line number? There are hundreds of
                                 published and unpublished Qumran manuscripts. What language
                                 (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, -- all three languages are among the
                                 Qumran witnesses)? Is this reading in a biblical manuscript, or in
                                 a liturgical text, or quoted in a non canonical apocalyptic work?
                                 If I look up the siglum &amp;gothicQ in the introduction to the
                                 text, I am simply informed that "&amp;gothicQ" refers to
                                 discoveries made at Chirbet Qumran and published in the series DJD
                                 (Discoveries of the Judean Desert), 1960ff. Now, if I didn't know
                                 any better, I might hunt through all DJD volumes to find this
                                 Qumran reading bearing on Deut 32:8, but would not find it. The
                                 text is actually published (yet not in full editio princeps) in two
                                 journal articles, as I determine from other bibliographic research.
                                 When I read the articles and look at the only published photograph,
                                 I discover that the Qumran reading (bny 'lhym) is actually
                                 *neither* of the two alternatives offered by the editor, who
                                 proposed either "bny 'l" or "bny 'lym". The correct reading was
                                 published in 1959, though the editor of BHS did his work in 1972.
                                 Thus, the siglum &amp;gothicQ is entirely misleading, a mere cipher
                                 alerting me to the existence of Qumran evidence for this text,
                                 which I have to find for myself and read for myself. The
                                 interpretation actually given in the app crit is wrong. </ab>
                              <ab>(c) The siglum &amp;gothicG means that the "Old Greek" (as
                                 determined through careful sifting of hundreds of Greek manuscripts
                                 and daughter versions dependent upon the Old Greek) has a bearing
                                 on the text at this lemma. But since the Old Greek had no Hebrew
                                 reading at all, the citing of this siglum should be accompanied by
                                 an indication of what the Old Greek reading was, and whether its
                                 retroversion to Hebrew is assured, and with what level of
                                 confidence, and on what grounds, and with what precise Hebrew
                                 result. It may be that the Greek reading which follows in
                                 parenthesis constitutes part of that evidence: but there is no
                                 grammar telling what "parentheses" means in this syntactic
                                 relationship; a human would not know for sure what the
                                 parenthesized reading
                                 (&lt;greekfont&gt;&amp;smoothbreathing;&amp;alpha;&amp;gamma;&amp;gamma;&amp;epsi;&amp;acute;
                                 &amp;lambda;&amp;omega;&amp;nu
                                 &amp;theta;&amp;epsi;&amp;ogr;&amp;tilde&lt;/greekfont&gt;) "angels
                                 of god" means for this textual variant. It's presence between the
                                 Old Greek siglum and that of Symmachus (another Greek witness)
                                 suggests that it might pertain to the Old Greek tradition. So we
                                 now turn to the standard critical edition of the (Old) Greek
                                 Deuteronomy (the Goettingen Septuagint volume, 1977) to explicate
                                 the ambiguity. We find that the eclectic text of the Goettingen LXX
                                 reads "sons of god" not "angels of God." Studying carefully the
                                 apparatus of the Goettingen LXX presents a confusing picture, so we
                                 turn to the companion volume of textual commentary which supports
                                 the Goettingen Septuagint (Text History of the Greek Deuteronomy.
                                 MSU XIII. 1978). There we find that the reading of the eclectic
                                 text in the critical edition is not attested in the extant Greek
                                 manuscripts themselves, but is inferred from the (derivative-of
                                 Old-Greek) Armenian text and from a partial reading in one very
                                 prestigious text in Greek (manuscript 848, dating to the middle of
                                 the first century B.C.E.). So it turns out, on further inspection,
                                 that the reading apparently attached to "Old Greek" in BHS is
                                 wrong, or at best, entirely misleading. Again: the siglum served as
                                 a cipher alerting us that the Old Greek tradition has relevant
                                 testimony bearing on this Hebrew text, and we will have to find it
                                 and study it.</ab>
                              <ab>(d) The next siglum
                                 &lt;greekfont&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/greekfont&gt;&amp;acute; says that
                                 the late Greek reviser Symmachus has a reading which reflects one
                                 of the two Hebrew alternatives suggested by the editor. But what is
                                 Symmachus' reading in Greek? On what grounds can it be claimed to
                                 support one of the two Hebrew readings which follow as the editor's
                                 proposals? We are not told: we must find a copy of Symmachus and
                                 make our own evaluation.</ab>
                              <ab>(e) The next siglum (&amp;gothicL) tells us that Old Latin
                                 supports a Vorlage like one of the two proposed Hebrew readings (or
                                 perhaps just a reading in support of the (now exposed) "Old Greek,"
                                 but we cannot tell for sure. In either case, can we trust this
                                 judgment? What does Old Latin read (in Latin)? Is the Old Latin
                                 reading secure at this locus, and on what basis is it claimed as
                                 support? We must find the Old Latin ourselves and make the
                                 evaluation.</ab>
                              <ab>(f) The superscript "Syh" following &amp;gothicL is curious for
                                 being superscripted (presumably a typographic error, but demands
                                 investigation). In any case, we are not told what "the" Syriac
                                 reading is, in what manuscripts/authors it is found, and on what
                                 basis it can be claimed to support the Old Greek (as indirect
                                 evidence) or one the Hebrew readings proposed by the editor? </ab>
                              <ab>(g) The two Hebrew readings proposed by the editor cannot be used
                                 directly by software: (a) as direct substitutes for the lemma (b)
                                 as alternatives to be compared to the lemma. The lemma carries full
                                 orthography for vocalization (vowels) and cantillation (tone,
                                 pitch), and thus embeds 4 or 5 distinct strata of Hebrew
                                 orthography in one particular script; the proposed Hebrew variants
                                 in this case use the same script, but contain mixed orthographies,
                                 with only partial vocalization and no cantillation. One could
                                 propose that software absorb the burden of identifying
                                 transcriptional systems, orthographic strata and then generating
                                 normalizations, but I doubt this would be wise: if editors use
                                 mixed orthography with words, the encoding should identify this.
                                 Thus, the encoding would require that the scholar supply linguistic
                                 information which is only inferred (though easily by humans) in the
                                 critical apparatus.</ab>
                              <ab>(h) Finally, the app crit supplies no information about witnesses
                                 that support the lemma. All Masoretic texts? A majority? How about
                                 the Samaritan Pentateuch? And where is the editor's explanation for
                                 the lemma's reading "sons of Israel" in place of the alternative
                                 "sons of (the) god(s)"? What is the justification for the editor's
                                 judgment "&lt;emp&gt;prb recte&lt;/&gt;"?</ab></ab>

                           <p>The app crit for the 4th textual reading in BHS Deuteronomy 32:8 is a
                              more like a footnote or pointer to external textual evidence than a
                              record of precise textual evidence. The scholar must locate and
                              evaluate several other sources to determine what the alternate
                              readings are, what their inter-relationships are, and credentials
                              these readings have in support of the editor's two alternatives. From
                              the perspective of a traditional critical apparatus, the major
                              elements are indeed present: lemma, variand(s), witnesses. But
                              essential information is missing: annotations to these witnesses and
                              readings expressed in terms of objects which can be pronounced,
                              written-out, classified and counted. An encoding of this information
                              in a form useful for analysis would need to contain much more
                              information.</p>
