             Advance Program and Registration Information

          International Conference on Electronic Publishing,
                Document  Manipulation, and Typography

                        September 18-20, 1990

About the conference

EP90, "Electronic Publishing '90," is the third in a series of
international conferences dedicated to all areas of electronic publishing,
document manipulation, and digital typography.  Widely regarded as the
premier forum for reporting new research developments in these fields, the
EP conference series has attracted scientists and engineers from leading
academic, research, and industrial organizations around the world.  The
British Computer Society sponsored EP86, held in Nottingham, England and
INRIA sponsored EP88, held in Nice, France.

EP90 will be held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(formerly the National Bureau of Standards) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, close
to Washington, D. C., from Tuesday, September 18th through Thursday,
September 20th, 1990.  An associated exhibition will provide an opportunity
for participants to see commercial and research systems in action.

A broad definition of electronic publishing is adopted to encompass all
aspects of computer-assisted preparation, presentation, transmittal,
storage, and retrieval of documents.  Topics include traditional paper-based
documents; hypertexts and hypermedia; font design (both latin and non-latin
alphabets); experience with structured document preparation systems; the
intersection with and application of database systems and software
engineering environments; the theoretical foundations for document models
and systems; character, text and document recognition and manipulation;
experience with standards; and documents with actively computed content.

The proceedings of EP90 will be published by Cambridge University Press in
its Electronic Publishing Series and a copy will be provided to each
conference registrant.

Subject:      Workshop on Textual and Lexical Issues at COLING-90

              WORKSHOP ON TEXTUAL AND LEXICAL RESOURCES
                     9-12 Sunday, 19 August 1990
                   At COLING-90, Helsinki, FINLAND

                [Check at registration for location]

Work in computational linguistics is becoming increasingly sensitive
to the need for natural language data.  Data are critical for theory
formulation, for the development of practical applications in the
language industries, and, in particular, for the evaluation of
computational linguistics as a whole.  Of particular interest from
this point of view are recent activities concerned with the collection
of text files, with the creation of lexical data and knowledge
bases, and with the development of ways to increase the ability to
reuse and share both data and tools.  The results will increase
the possibility and likelihood of cooperation across a broad range
of areas in computational linguistics.

This workshop will provide an open and informal forum within which
these activities are discussed and their relationship to current
research and development established.  The results will be reported
on during COLING-90.  There are no restrictions on participation
and there is no need to register specifically for the workshop.

From: Stig Johansson <h_johansson%use.uio.uninett@nac.no>
Subject: How far SGML?
Message-Id: <805*h_johansson@use.uio.uninett>

Does everything have to be expressed through SGML? Is it good for all
types of texts? Cf the recent book by Herwijnen (1990: 12): 'A tree
representation can be used to describe many documents, but not all.'

Even if SGML can be made to do the work, is it the best way for all
texts and all types of textual features? For example, can it be used for
the discourse transcription needed in a spoken corpus without cluttering
up the text hopelessly? Why not try to convert a discourse transcription
to SGML-type tagging?

You will say - everything does not need to be keyboarded - there are
possibilities of tag minimization - tags can be suppressed, etc. But we
do want to be able to see the text simultaneously tagged for speaker
overlap. stress, intonation, etc. You will say - but SGML is for the
interchange format - it can be converted to/from a local format. The
best thing would be, however, if we could have a usable interchange
format or, at least, if we could minimize the difference between the
interchange format and local formats. Otherwise, who will bother to use
the interchange format?

What I am really asking is: what harm does it do if we can find some
simpler way of expressing, for example, intonation or word class?

Finally, are we really sure that we can define in advance a grammar for
textual features? This is what the DTD does (for a particular type of
text).

These are some of the questions that need careful consideration. Or am I
just being stupid?

Re: Stig's concerns over whether SGML should always be used to represent
all texts.

There has been one category of material which from the beginning I have
concluded should not be represented in SGML. From this category I
believe one can abstract a general principle of what types of material
are not best served in SGML garb.

The category was programming language code. The reason was that since a
compiler existed for such code, it was not only unnecessary to convert
such material into SGML, it was outright harmful.

Since then, I've come to conclude that DBMS loader stream information
likewise should not be converted into SGML tagging. The reasoning is
similar, that it is a formal language already, which is checked by its
own software. In the case of database data, however, it was concluded
that there might be another form of the information from which the
database loader stream could be derived, and that this other format
might itself be an SGML format.

The general principle seems to be that what makes using SGML worthwhile
is that software exists to make use of the format and software exists to
validate the content of the format. Whenever other software exists for
another format, the utility of SGML is lessened to the degree that this
other software provides all the formal computational capabilities that
SGML provides.

However, there is another principle which should be stated.

It is that most criteria which concern  `readability' or `legibility'
for human users of text are in fact  derivable by  software from less
readable and less legible forms of information which  are more useful to
computers.  Using a computer is a bit of a Faustian deal.  We gain
capabilities to do things, but lose a bit of the ability actually to
understand the raw information from which these capabilities derive.

Subject:      WHAT *SHOULDN'T* SGML DO?

Re: Lou Burnard's "Subject: How far SGML?"

Lou must have strong confidence in his friendships to have posted
an exchange between Stig Johansson and Bob Amsler "without asking
permission of either of them."

Stig's queries ("Does everything have to be expressed through SGML?
Is it good for all types of texts? ... Even if SGML can be made to do
the work, is it the best way for all texts and all types of textual
features?), in light of his subsequent comment, can be understood to
ask whether KNOWLEDGE/ANALYSIS OF ALL KINDS *about* a text is best
represented, in all kinds of texts, by SGML.  Amsler's (posted)
response in paraphrase (..."whether SGML should always be used to
represent all texts...category of material") seems to focus on
format and content, and validation of these.  Stig's question seems
to ask about propriety, economy, felicity.  When I remind everyone
that we need character-level and morpheme-level annotations on texts
for representation of codices, textual criticism and linguistic
analysis -- the question may be whether we WANT to use an SGML id
marker for every character in the text, or whether we hand off some
of the cross-referencing/parsing problems to applications software.

I may be wrong in this interpretation of the exchange, but even if so,
let me expand the question.  Part of the issue seems to be: when should
we let the applications do type-checking on the data (Amsler eliminates
program code from SGML coding because compilers do the validation)
and when do we declare detailed rules in a document DTD?  If the
applications already exist, the question is moot: they validate or
they do not.  In other cases, it's a fresh choice: new text being
authored or structured, and new software process the encoded text.  Do
we require that the exchange format (SGML) validate *everything* that
the local application controls with integrity checks?

An example would be citations, whether of bibliographic data or
internal references in classical literature.  One *could* use SGML
(the DTD, with entities, attributes and tags) in an authoring system
to make sure that nobody ever typed "Sirach 23:30" (since Sirach chapter
23 has fewer than 30 verses).  Is that the best way to validate the
legitimacy of citations?  Or is there a more economical way for ALL
applications to validate citations, so that we can leave deep-level
SGML structuring markup out of the interchange format?

This is a more benign case than worries Stig, though (I think).  He
seems to be concerned with the important matter of representing
knowledge and analysis of texts (not visible, surface features having
to do with rules of containment) and questioning whether SGML always
the best way to do this.  Perhaps Bob answered adequately, and it's
taking me a while to see how Bob's generalization answers all the
questions.

Subject:      New SGML search engine?

I have just received a slightly technical overview of the capabilities
of the new text retrieval system from Information Dimensions,
BASIS-PLUS, in which the following paragraphs caught my eye:-
<quote>
BASISPlus recognizes an extensive subset of Standard generalized
Markup Language (SGML) to import and export marked up documents and
intelligently comprehend and display document attributes identified by
the markup. SGML is  ... [brief description of markup concepts,
usefulness of descriptive markup etc.] ... Documents stored in
BASISplus contain text with embedded markup in the form of the
BASISplus Generalised Markup Language (BGML). BGML is based on the
identification of document structure using descriptive markup. BGML
enables BASISplus to recognize the attributes of the text stored in
the BDIF format. BGML is derived from and is consistent with SGML.

At presentation time, the BASISplus Markup and Style Guide is referenced
to determine how to format the text and where to find the external
entities. It contains the definitions for markup elements, entity
references and processing procedures. A standard set of markup
elements is supplied with BASISplus and users can create customized
markup elements. Only the rules need to be edited; documents are
unchanged and are not exposed to editing errors. BASISplus requires all
the definitions of the markup elements and entity references to be
precompiled into a Markup and Style Guide  [...]

The Markup and Style Guide is a BASISplus repository contaioning
specifications for:
- Converters used to import and export documents [other formats mentioned
include Revisable Form WP, Flatfiles, DDIF Compound Docs, DIF ]
- Parsers used to locate 'context units' in the text of a document
- Presenters used to prepoare a document for viewing
- Markup language declarations for documents that contain markup
elements and entity references used for descriptive markup
</quote>

If this is only half as good as it sounds, it's worth a second look.
OUCS is currently negotiating with Info Dimensions to upgrade our
current Basis systems to BasisPlus. I'll keep you posted...
