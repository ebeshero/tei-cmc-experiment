We at the Unicode working group thought that you might be interested
in hearing about this.

The text is a (slightly updated) copy of a short announcement that we put out
on several aliases in December.  We are actively soliciting review of the

Unicode in Final Review Stage

After many years of practical experience implementing
multilingual computer systems, information professionals from
various corporations shared a common frustration in dealing
with the incompleteness and complexity of multilingual
character code standards.  In 1989 a working group of
engineers, managers, linguists, and information professionals from
companies and institutions whose business required
multilingual information systems formed a working group to
develop a model for an international character code for
multilingual information processing.  Collaborating companies
included Apple, IBM, Metaphor, Microsoft, NeXT, Research
Libraries Group, Sun, Xerox and others.

The product of the collaboration is called Unicode.  Unicode is
a world wide, fixed-width, 16-bit character encoding scheme for
text characters.

In January 1991, the Unicode Consortium incorporated to
bring Unicode to the world under the sponsorship of a
multi-corporate, multi-national, non-profit organization.       A
primary goal of the consortium is to establish Unicode itself
as a de facto international character standard while continuing to
propose its adoption by national and international standards
organizations.  Membership in the consortium is open to all who
support Unicode principles.

The specification for Unicode Version 1.0 is due for release in
early 1991.   For a copy of the final review draft of the proposed
Unicode standard, contact, Unicode Final Review , c/o

Re: Phonetic transcription software for modern English

I could offer to anyone phonetic transcription software for modern
English (free of charge, quality not checked yet). Transcription
software for modern German, high quality, but expensive, will soon be
available at the INSTITUT FUER ANGEWANDTE KOMMUNIKATIONS- UND
SPRACHFORSCHNG E.V., POPPELSDORFER ALLEE 47, D-5300 BONN 1. I still
need phonetic transcription software for modern French. I would be
delighted to be given a helping hand on the present occasion via
SERTEL at DGOGWDG1.BITNET. (Pardon me, TEI subscribers not interested
in this stuff which might be important, though, to some of you,
as it is for me).

Subject:      report on a recent workshop

Readers of TEI-L may be interested in this report on a workshop on
(library treatment of) computer files held last week here in Chicago.
The existence of the workshop (held in conjunction with the ALA
midwinter meeting here in town) and the good attendance at it bear
witness to the growing interest of librarians in ensuring that
machine-readable texts can be successfully integrated into the normal
range of library services much as other non-book materials have been.

Not all examples of library alphabet soup have been expanded, on the
theory that most interested readers will know their expansions (queries
to me individually please, not the list).

Meeting Report, C. M. Sperberg-McQueen

Research Libraries Group Computer Files Workshop

January 11, 1991

The Research Libraries Group held a one-day workshop on computer files
at the University of Chicago's Regenstein Library on Friday, 11 January
1991.  The workshop addressed the major issues confronted by research
libraries as they acquire computer files and assist patrons in their
use; general sessions on the nature and uses of computer files in the
social sciences and the humanities were followed by more specialized
discussions of cataloging and management issues and the internal
construction of social science data sets.

The morning began with a talk on "The History and Nature of Computer
Files in the Humanities and Social Sciences" by Judith Rowe of Princeton
University and C. M. Sperberg-McQueen of the University of Illinois and
the TEI (a ringer at this meeting, since UIC is an OCLC library).  The
speakers began with a discussion of the various ways machine-readable
data files are structured (in part as a function of the technologies
available for processing them) and then embarked on a historical tour of
work with machine-readable data files.  The tour began in earnest in the
1930s, though preliminary retrospective glances went as far back as the
Masoretic study of the Old Testament text in the years 500-1000 of the
common era (introduction of word- and letter-counts and invention of the
checksum) and the invention of the note card.  From the welter of names,
dates, and places, the auditors gained (they said later) a good sense of
the variety of uses to which researchers have put machine-readable data
and the long history behind the field as it currently exists.

The latter half of the morning was given over to a panel discussion of
"Electronic Files:  Use and the Library" chaired by John Price-Wilkin of
the University of Michigan.  Lynn Marko, the head of monographic
cataloguing at the University of Michigan, spoke about Michigan's
experience providing standard-level cataloguing for materials at the
Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR);
despite the information about the files contained in ICPSR's own
guidebook and the preparatory work done by ICPSR and RLG in the project,
the Michigan cataloguers found vast amounts of work still to do.  Most
difficult for them, Marko said, was the adjustment from two usual
assumptions of cataloguing work:  that the library owns the material
being catalogued, and that the cataloguer has a hard copy of the
material in hand and can inspect it directly.  Both of these can be
problematic for machine-readable data:  the library is often cataloguing
material owned by some other unit of the university (or, as in
Michigan's case, by a consortium not part of the university at all), and
the computer files are often not directly accessible to the cataloguer
-- and seldom have normal bibliographic information attached to them
even if they are.  (This note recurred throughout the workshop:  the
failure of makers of machine-readable files to provide in-file
information corresponding to a title-page and front-matter poses one of
the greatest barriers to proper bibliographic control of computer
files.)  Particular technical difficulties also occurred in assignment
of subject headings (LC subject headings simply don't lend themselves to
treatment of broad survey information) and interfaces with local systems
(Michigan's computer-files records were unusually long for MARC records
-- too long to load in their local system).  Difficult though the ICPSR
data had been, cataloguing text files acquired from the Oxford Text
Archive was even more difficult, because so much of the required
information was available neither from the computer file itself nor from
the archive.  The TEI recommendations for file headers should help
alleviate such problems, Marko said, but need to pay more attention to
standard titles and to specifying for commercial vendors what
constitutes adequate infile documentation of a file.

Anita Lowry of Columbia then described the Electronic Text Service
within the reference department of the library there.  She perceives an
imaginative leap being made by increasing numbers of faculty and
graduate students as they see the power of online systems and imagine
that power available for text searching and manipulation.  The
Electronic Text Service represents the library's attempt to provide
access to the full range of research tools used today, supported by the
wide subject and specialized expertise needed, and to integrate
machine-readable files and software into the resources of the library as
a whole.  She described at some length the infrastructure required for
such successful integration and the approach taken at Columbia to
instruction (consciousness raising, training in the mechanics of the
software, consulting in the selection of tools, training materials, and
a 1.5 credit graduate course in research methods).  She ended by urging
the need to integrate computer files and tools into the library as a
whole and to avoid ghettoizing them.

Ann Gray, the data archivist at the Cornell Institute for Social and
Economic Research (CISER), then discussed the type of service to be
aimed at by local data archives.  Much of the conventional wisdom of
data processing can be applied to data archive work:  divide the
problem, keep things simple, and don't make the solution tricky.  The
use of the material determines the information needs of the user.  It is
not enough to make data available to users; the data archivist must also
be able to advise on the applicability of particular statistical
measures to particular data sets.  The goal must be to provide a level
of service which is that of a colleague knowledgeable in the field.

After lunch, parallel sessions were held on humanities files and
social-science files.  The humanities session was chaired by Marianne
Gaunt of Rutgers, and featured remarks by Anita Lowry, John
Price-Wilkin, and Mark Olsen of the ARTFL (American and French Research
on the Treasury of the French Language) project at the University of
Chicago.  John Price-Wilkin began by describing the work he has done to
provide machine-readable texts and search software at Michigan.  PAT and
Lector running on an IBM RS6000 with 3 Gb of disk space, attached to the
university network, provide access to files acquired from the Oxford
Text Archive and retagged locally for access through PAT.  (The revised,
retagged versions go back to Oxford for redeposit in the archive.)
Typical problems with missing bibliographic data and eccentric markup
were described, together with the solutions found so far.

Marianne Gaunt at this point described the RLG/Rutgers project to
develop MARC records for the holdings of the Oxford Text Archive.  An
archivist has been hired to go through the archive's paper files and
produce hard copy extracts from each text for the use of a cataloguer in
the Bodleian, who makes a MARC record in the local DOBIS system, which
is then transferred to RLG for loading in RLIN.  Descriptive information
on the markup schemes employed in the archive's texts is woefully
lacking.

Anita Lowry discussed some of the problems encountered in making
electronic texts available in machine-readable form.  She stressed the
distinction between commercially produced texts with clear publication
data, documentation of copy text and modifications, identification of
the markup scheme employed, and manuals, at one end of the spectrum,
from the other end of the spectrum with 'unpublished' texts lacking
documentation, quality control, and support.  The main sources of files,
she said, were projects (for which Michael Neuman's listing of projects
was a valuable finding tool), commercial publishers (notably Electronic
Text Corporation, Oxford University Press, and Intellex), archives such
as OTA, and individuals.

Mark Olsen concluded the session with a paper on the uses of
machine-readable texts in which he concluded that so far computers in
the humanities has had no impact on the practice of textual scholarship,
because it has (a) lacked sufficient explicit theoretical reflection and
clear theoretical basis and (b) ghettoized itself in marginal journals
instead of publishing in the various mainstreams of the relevant
disciplines.  Computers should be used to do things that cannot usefully
be done by hand; massive vocabulary studies of the sort done by John
Burrows in his book on Austen were a good example of what should be
done.

During the second half of the afternoon, technical sessions and
demonstrations of systems were intermingled.  This writer saw a
demonstration of the Philo/Philis interface to the ARTFL data base
(fairly conventional word-form searches with slightly better than
average treatment of word-groups and dynamic definitions of the corpus
to be searched) and attended the discussion section on cataloguing
issues, where specific issues of applying the MARC format for
machine-readable data files were aired by practicing cataloguers.  The
most prominent systematic problems were the psychological difficulty for
cataloguers of describing an item they did not have in hand, and the
practical difficulty that even if the item was in hand (i.e. the
cataloguer could mount the tape and dump the files) it often had no
internal identifying information and was useless as a source of
cataloguing information.  The need to educate producers of data files to
the need for reliable documentation was repeatedly stressed.

The workshop as a whole impressed on this observer the strong commitment
of the library community to expanding their current ability to handle
machine-readable files and integrate them into library resources.  It
also confirmed the potential usefulness of the TEI encoding scheme as a
common, fully documented, markup scheme and of the TEI's decision to
include an infile header providing the information most needed for
library-level cataloguing of the file.

Subject:  Survey Report
   LITERATURE NEEDS SURVEY RESULTS

   In late November l990 the TEI Working Group on Literature Texts
sent out a survey to try and identify the needs of people working
in literature with computers.
   Fifty-three responses were received to date.  The following
file contains a summary of the responses.  To facilitate use of
the data some organisational principles were applied to it.
First, responses were classified into two groups:
1. Experienced interdisciplinary scholars, generally defined as
   people working in literature who have input texts, used texts from
   elsewhere, processed them and, usually  published results based on
   their use of the computer.  There were 40 responses from such people.
2. Other, people who are not literature scholars, not experienced with
   literature texts, etc.  There were 14 responses from such people.
   These responses are not included in the following summary.

   The questions from the Questionnaire are repeated followed by a line
of responses; the numbers indicate the number
of respondants who checked each category; a category "Not Answered"
is added where appropriate.  After this line are found copies
of all comments submitted by the first group of respondants.  The
numbers (1) to (40) permit the user to identify comments from a
given respondant from one question to the next without revealing names.

   We wish, in transmitting this report, to thank all those who have
given the committee their time and advice in this matter.  We wish
also to thank those who expressed solidarity with our work by sending
in the form although literature is not their field, a number of whom
appended a note to that effect.

   If you wish to help us with further comments please send them to
me at FORTIER@UOFMCC.BITNET, or by paper post to Paul A. Fortier,
Department of French and Spanish, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg,
Man., R3T 2N2, CANADA.

                  Cordially,
                          Paul A. Fortier,
                          for the Literature Working Group.

I. Standards for Literature Texts.

I would rate the importance of the indicated categories to standards
for literature texts as follows:

A. Bibliographical Information : (Place, date of publication, edition,
   printing, etc):
32_Essential  7_Important  __Not important  1_Should not be included

Further  comments:
(2)
 The TEI Guidelines I thought did an excellent
job of setting standards for these.
(10)
Documentation for early texts should make clear whether the spelling is old, or
modernised to English or American standards.
(16)
:  This information or some of the categories may
be essential, depending on the case.  For me, the date & edition.
(22)
*IF* facsimiles can be included in text-bases
(26)
  Electronic texts that do not correspond to known printed
editions make accurate citations impossible.
(28)
That bibliographic information be given is essential.  That it be
absolutely standard in form is only important.
(34)
   Though I sometimes think it would be just as helpful if, for a given
corpus, such details were included in a separate file.
(35)
Without bibliographic information the text would be useless
for any comparative study.
(38)
 Just place and date

B. Formal Characteristics (Chapters and sub-chapters, page and line
   Breaks, stanza divisions, speakers in plays, stage directions, etc.):
35_Essential  5_Important  __Not important  __Should not be included

Further  comments:
(2)
 Representation of the physical characteristics of the
edition or MS used is very important.
(4)
In order to cite lexical searches, a textual location is
essential.
(10)
  In an archive, it is best to include all; the researcher can
remove unwanted items.
(16)
  Chapter or story divisions are often essential for me.
(24)
== rather a vague question: stage directions are not the
same kind of formal characteristic as chapter divisions
or line breaks,
(26)
  Plays and poems have standard reference systems for
location but prose fiction does not.  Here electronic identifications
may have no hard copy equivalents.
(28)
    If you don't have the formal structure, you don't have the work.
(29)
By no means do all texts involved in the study of literature merit the
efforts of received texts in terms of the extent of encoded informa-
tion.  The proceedings of an historical society, for instance, may
be quite useful in the study of particular literature, but they
may not be worth the effort required to provide full tagging.
(33)
This question seems to mix together several sorts of characteristics:
structural divisions (chapters, lines in poetry, stanzas), pieces of
text (stage directions), and typographical features which may have
little relation to the work's form (most page breaks, line breaks in
prose). Perhaps it would be more productive to ask two questions, about
formal characteristics and typographical characteristics; the formal
characteristics always need to be marked, but it's not always important
to indicate things like line breaks in prose, depending on what you
plan to do with the text.
(34)
   Line breaks seem frquently less helpful except in verse and for
manuscripts, especially since the best search programs do their own
counting.
(35)
These elements are important if the text base is to be used
for anything other that individual-item storage.
(36)
With maximum flexibility for representing alternative
punctuation, breaks etc. WHENEVER these are not authorial/editorial absolutes.
(39)
Page and line breaks not important unless the first edition is a
printed edition.
Ancient and ms texts should not have the pagination of modern editions
in them.

C. Grammatical Information (Basic Form, Part of Speech, Inflection
   Identification, etc):
 5_Essential 15_Important  5_Not important 10_Should not be included
 5_Not Answered

Further  comments:
(2)
Standards for this information need to be
provided for scholars who are interested in it, but provision
should be optional.
(4)
  While this would be nice, it would take forever! (I know from
experience.)  Furthermore, it would make the files extremely
long.
(6)
The inclusion of morphological information might be essential
for some purposes for some texts, but (given how much work is
involved in coding such information) I would not want to make
this a standard feature.
(7)
 Not for lit. e-texts like those I usually use.
(8)
Some scholars with lexicographical and syntactic interests will find
such information central; literary analysis will generally not require
such markup.
(10)
Two versions should be held when possible; one with, the other without
such information.
(11)
Conservative treatment preferred, with full account of categories
and decisions
(16)
  These categories are essential for me, but I am not
convinced that generic e-texts should be tagged this way unless by the experts
on grammar & the author.
(19)
Parts of Speech: A lot of variation in assigning their characteristics
exists.  Could be helpful if consistent.
(20)
But not necessarily in the standard encoding.  There could be a
companion analytical apparatus.
(24)
Rather depends on the application
(26)
  I don't work currently in this area so I have no comment.
(27)
For this and the following categories, I don't mean to suggest that
that every etext deposited in an archive should be required "by law"
to encode such features, but I DO mean that standard ways for coding
these features should be developed and published by the TEI.
(28)
All interpretation of linguistic objects (including literature)
is based on linguistic understanding.  Without ways to distinguish
the various interpretations of an ambiguity, we cannot handle
much serious work.
(34)
   This is immediately a more contentious element, since the
categorization is inevitably less "objective".
(35)
While this is not important to the ways in which I see myself
using an electronic text, it might be important to a
linguist.
(36)
Difficult.  Emphasis must be on flexibility, and avoiding any hint of
prescription which would encourage the tail to wag the dog.  I'd be interested
in anything that could relate this sort of tagging (of, eg, syntactical/semantic
ambiguities or surface v. deep grammatical structures) with methods of
representing such tensions dynamically.  Distinction between tagging WITHIN the
text and in separate files which could be integrated with the text is
presumably important here.
(37)
I do use this, but this depends on the use to which the text is put;
sometimes this information gets in the way.
(39)
I really think that this should be done by the researcher, not by the
text preparer.

D. Metrical Information for Poetry:
 3_Essential 23_Important  5_Not important  3_Should not be included
 6_Not Answered

Further  comments:
(1)
Hard for me to say. To what extent can metrics be
automatically determined? If poorly, then this is ess.
(2)
Here again, this information is useful and
standards for it should be established, but it should not be
required.  I am somewhat more in favor of providing it as a
matter of course, simply because it can generally provided in
a relatively easy fashion if you are thinking only of such
things as line length and rhyme scheme.  More detailed
information (such as hiatus, synalepha, etc.) would
normally be omitted.
(4)
   I'm not sure.  For my purposes, it is not necessary.
(6)
The inclusion of metrical information might be essential
for some purposes for some texts, but (given how much work is
involved in coding such information) I would not want to make
this a standard feature.
(7)
depends totally on what is prepared for whom.
(8)
Important but subjective.  Required markup should be descriptive
and (more or less) objective.
(10)
Two versions should be held when possible; one with, the other without
such information.
(18)
This can get rather complicated, especially with mixed meters, but
should still be done.
(21)
Essential to me, but perhaps not to everyone
(26)
 I don't work currently in this area so I have no comment.
(28)
If this is not defined, it will just have to be invented.  (Ditto,
of course, if it's defined but not in a useful way.)
(33)
The separation of this from categories C and E is, I hope, meant to
suggest that it falls in between the categories of fact and
interpretation.  There exist a number of different theories of English
prosody, and a standard can, at best, provide tags for some of these
particular theories, none likely to be the last word.  The situation for
other languages may be simpler.
(34)
        Of less relevance to French than to stress-timed languages.
(35)
     Most folk can work this out for themselves.
(36)
Ditto.  A generally accepted standard for generally accepted metrical
principles would cope with the majority of conventional poetic texts by
conventional researchers, and standard for such tagging would be valuable.
As long as electronic text also encourages unconventional approaches with
non-restricting guidelines i.e. tagging which allows text/analysis interchange
and which is conformant with SGML/TEI sensitive programs but with the greatest
freedom for researcher-defined categories within these constraints.
(39)
But metrical analysis is often a matter of controversy.
Can the text preparer distinguish agreed-upon from contentious issues?

E. Interpretative Information (e.g. Narrative vs. expository
   passages, direct and indirect discourse, point of view, themes,
   images, allusions, etc.):
 8_Essential  7_Important  4_Not important 20_Should not be included
 2_Not Answered

Further  comments:
(1)
Because such "information" is so mortal, there should
always be a version at least without this in it, and it should be last
on the list of things to do. NB: it is this category of information
that interests me the most!
(2)
The problem with this category is that it becomes
increasingly subjective. The more subjective it is, the less
justification there is for including it as part of a standardized
text; although, again, tags should be provided.
(4)
The direct discourse should be clear from quotes.  I presume you
will include the normal punctuation of the text in addition to
any extra material you may need.
(6)
Many of these items are NOT objectively verifiable, and how
such things are coded will vary from one researcher to another.
The chances that a text marked up with these features would
meet my needs is slim: even if I wanted such things marked, I
would probably NOT like the way someone else had marked them.
(7)
doing work of critic; will it reliable?
(8)
If I were marking up etexts for my own analysis, I would certainly
encode such features; however, given the subjective nature of most of
these interpretations, I would be reluctant to endorse such markup
as part of a minimal TEI standard.
(10)
Two versions should be held when possible; one with, the other without
such information.
(11)
   Conservative treatment preferred, with full account of decisions
(13)
 Images, allusions, espec. indications of foreign languages
, geographical locations--these need to be coded.
(16)
 Most of these I consider my domain of research, but would
of course be interested in evaluating & perhaps using the results of others.
I would find the narrative discourse attributions extremely useful (e.g.,
1st, 2nd, 3rd person).
(19)
Too much dependent on interpretation.
(20)
All these categories are potentially very useful, but once again would
belong in a companion encoding.
(24)
   Some odd bed fellows here.
(26)
 If identified, this annotation can be of extraordinary
value.
(28)
I would like to be able to tag/distinguish:
   - narrative vs. exposition (and all the other distinctions
     suggested by Barthes in L'analyse structurale du re/cit)
   - direct and indirect discourse; point of view
   - themes, images, topics
   - division of text into scenic/narrative structural units
        (e.g. Propp's and competing analyses of tale structure)
        Divergent analyses must be allowed.
(31)
 FOR MOST OF THIS STUFF, THE CODING WOULD BETOO SUBJECTIVE
(34)
        Probably too contentious to systematize comprehensively, and
(for example) a merely partial (or flawed) identification of themes or
imagery can actively mislead.
(35)
This kind of interjection is to be avoided at all costs.  The
text should remain as clear and simple as it can be.
(36)
Ditto.  Any coding should work to loosen the web of the text and encourage its
multivalence to be exploited in a non-print medium.  Exciting potential here,
I'd have thought.  How can coding facilitate the exposition of multiple levels
of, say "point of view" or the complexity of "themes", without constricting
them?  Can coding be sufficiently sensitive to maximize the examination of
tensions between, say, overt levels of meaning, and, perhaps covert or
subverted/-sive levels caused by dislocations within the varying "points of
 view"
(authorially intended, historically and culturally conditioned, skewed by time,
class, gender, race, etc. or the sheer slipperiness of the signifiers
themselves) or between such semantic levels and
 accoustic/semiotic/paralinguistic
levels?
(38)
Can this be optional - separate file.
(39)
This is a mixed bag.
Such material should be put in by the researcher, as a rule, not the
mark-up people.
But direct vbs. indirect discourse vs. exposition (or whatever) can
safely be marked up.
As to the rest, let's have guidelines for how a commentator might
make his electronic commentary TEI-observant, but keep notes on images,
illusions, etc. out of standard E-texts.
However where a quotation or paraphrase is from a known source, it
should be tagged with a 'soruceof quatation'  marker.

Please Specify Important items in this category:
(19)
I prefer "clean" text without extraneous tags other than identifiers.
(20)
Direct and indirect discourse, images, point of view, allusions
(24)
    Discourse levels (narrative, quoted speech, allusions)
(34)
        Some uniformity in the conventions used to indicate direct
speech MAY be desirable (or alternatively may actually be at odds with
an author's own practice.

F. In order to do my work as I prefer, I need generally
   accepted tags for the following aspects of texts (Please be as
   specific as possible.  This is not a test but an opportunity to
   express your wishes.  Please number your "wishes" and rank them
   in descending order of preference.):
(1)
1. B
2. A
3. C
(2)
1. Editorial annotations
2. Textual variants
3. Foreward and afterward material (author's prologue, translator's
prologue, dedicatory, poems dedicated to the author, legal license,
religious approbation, table of contents), rubrics, titles,
running heads, etc.
(3)
1.  tags should be given at the start of subdivisions so that words,
    sentences, etc., can be identified by position (i.e., by page
    in a standard printed edition, or by act and scene in plays, or
    by title in a collection of short stories or essays).

2.  If parallel variant text is given, it should not only be noted
    as such in a tag, but the tag should contain the length of the
    variant text so that a program can easily skip it in counts
    of the standard text.
(4)
1.  line number or chapter
2.  language
3.  part of speech, if included
(5)
1.    Page breaks

2. Speaker-tags
3. Tags for major homographic cases (e.g. to/to, that/that/that)
(12)
1. tags for placement, extent, and poss other info about illustrations
2. tags for hypertext and hypermedia (linking; filtering info
3. publishing history: ie, if form, say, chapoter divisions, changed
since original or first publication, e.g. Dickens and other periodical
authors then converted to book; this will be crucial when and if print
texts becomes widely available in electronic and hypertext forms, which
demand a different format.
(13)
1.    Proper names and places
2.    indication of languages used in the text
(14)
1. Formal Characteristics
(16)
1.  Lemma with disambiguation

In order to make 'handy' concondances I want to know if a word in
poetry is in a rhyming position.
(24)
1.    [will think about these further]
(25)
1. formal characteristics listed above
2. textual variants
3. font information
(26)
1. before tagging I require a verified text--most OTA texts I've used aren't
2. corresponding location(s) in standard edition(s)
3. textual variants in MSS versions, printed editions, comments
4. word and motif index, concordance, statistics, apparatus
(27)

2.  manuscript variations in the text
3.  structural decomposition of text

2. EDITION/SOURCE/VARIANT INFO
(32)
1. Because I work with medieval texts, marking up a text for variations in
   orthography (lemmatizing) would be very handy
2. Unique mark-up strings for runic characters (thorn, eth, etc.) would
   enable me to do global search and replace to insert my own versions
3. I ususally search for vocabulary especially synonyms and sometimes
   antonyms.  Standard tags to indicate vocabulary relationships would be
   useful if I wanted to share my marked-up text.
4. Tags for an editor's choice of type fonts and other typographical or
   manuscript features such as line breaks, rubrication, glosses, etc.
(33)
Since I'm more interested for my own work in the formal and
structural aspects of texts, the current standard generally seems
to cover the things I need right now.
(34)
1.  ACCENTED CHARACTERS
2.  Parts of speech
3.  Inflections (plurality, tense, etc)
(35)
1.   type faces and fonts
2.   diacriticals
(36)
I'm engaged at the moment in trying to use the computer to tease out textual
dynamics which cannot easily be expressed in linear form.  I'm using an
authoring package to investigate this and am intrigued by the possibilities for
textual analysis and for teaching.  Markup is effected not by inserting tags
around the word/phrase/morpheme or whatever at the same physical 'level' of
text, but by selecting (on Mac) the w/p/m etc and typing the coding into what
might be seen as an underlying level.  Many levels can be set up, allowing the
word etc to be coded according to different features at different levels, or
putting in alternatives at the same level
+ To take a simple example of the latter - the OE compound 'wintercearu'
(lit. 'winter-sorrow) - where the 1st el. (surface level/conventional
grammar - a noun), might be seen with varying degrees of validity with
adverbial, adjectival AND/OR substantival function depending upon the
relationships perceived between the two elements.  Similarly, 'cearu' may be
the surface grammatical subject of the clause, but at a deeper grammatical level
may function as object or agent.  All these glosses can be easily written in
as alternative codes, and the combinations and permutations examined
interactively within the wider context of the text.
By coding these and many other features (rhythmical patterns,
sound values, semantic resonances etc.) into set levels behind the words, and
then revealing the coding at the different levels, one can get some sort
of visual representation of the text's rhythmical pulses/alliterative patterns/
surface grammatical and semantic structures and the tensions between these and
other levels of syntax and meaning/etc etc.  This is very easy for the
user - click/replace - and sympathetic to the way in which the mind works
(not linear tags around, but levels behind and within the word).  Indeed, the
text can be seen to slip beteen levels on the screen.  There's no way, however,
in which such texts could be exchanged as they are entirely software/hardware
dependent, and yet they are highly encoded.  I just wonder whether more
textual analysis won't be done using increasingly sophisticated '3-dimensional'
approaches, with linear tagging very much the SECONDARY process - the result
rather than the initial parameters.  So my main interest is in the potential
ease of interface between such programs and standard-coded linear text, and
how readily TEI guidelines apply here.
(37)
1. Metrical Information
2. Grammatical
3. Narrative vs. direct discourse
(38)
I don't quite understand but
1. genre
2. original language of authorship
(39)
1. Clear and standard reference scheme to basic editins.
2. Elimination of 'typographical artefacts' (page-breaks, line-breaks,
   non-semantic hyphens, etc.).  If they are included, they must be
   tagged so I can strip them out easily.
3. Speaker identity, change of speaker, quotation and indirect discourse.

G. Futher suggestions to the Work Group on Literature Texts:

(3)
   Lines should never be longer than 80 characters and they should
   always end with ASCII 13 and 10.
(4)
  It would be nice to include translations as well as original
  works; perhaps reworking also.  I would particularly like to
  see a machine readable version of Berni's *Rifacimento* of
 Boiardo's *Orlando Innamorato* so that I could compare them
  side by side, for example.
(12)
Mostly matters that obviously follow from my last sugegstion.
(16)
Providing information with tagged text on corpora which include said text
would be very useful.
(18)
  Compile a library of "prosodic-phonological dictionaries" and/or
sets of algorithms to generate prosodic-phonemic transcriptions from
orthographic textx.
(19)
   Work with foreign language professional organisations.  Some have
guidelines already in place (Spanish).
(21)
   I need a program to transcribe verse into IPA symbole and to
perform metrical analysis.
(24)
  I assume it is OK to forward the questionnaire to as many likely
  literary types as I can think of. There seem to be quite a lot of
  very familiar email addresses in the current list!
(25)
Minimally tagged texts are better than no texts at all.
(29)
Tags are essential for proper retrieval of information, apart
from analysis of text.
(36)
[This is more concerned with the sort of editions it would be nice to have in
electronic archives].
 For medieval literature where oral delivery and non-author controlled
dissemination are particularly at odds with the medium of print and
authorial/editorial control, and where punctuation is imposed by the editor,
it would be good to have tagging which brings out the fluidity inherent in such
text.  If an edition is being prepared, the editor, who will have deeply
pondered textual cruces, alternative punctuation etc, could tag the choices
which will be used in the printed version, but leave the options embedded
within the electronic text
++ E.G. If an editor were editing an Old English text, using, say, a package
combining the nesting facilities as above with good standard editing facilities
(which must be the next development), then, when deciding how to punctuate the
text, they might put in punctuation choices as flexibly as possible at
positions of ambiguity (in an either/or/or.. facility).  To evolve towards a
final version for printing they could then click the one preferred in each case.

In which case the other choices disappear from the surface version, which is
fossilized in printed form, but remain underneath.  If an interface could
transfer the texts, with their underlying coding, to a standard format, then a
version of the text could exist from which an infinite no. of slightly different
versions/interpretation could be readily generated - one physical coded
text/several possible output forms.

The academic community would gain a dynamic text which would be so
much MORE than the static printed version.  We could benefit from the editor's
particular expertise and insights, recovering some of the things that usually
end up in the bin.  (Printed version 100% manifest, all choices which were
rejected 0% represented - even if the decision between alternatives was 51/49).

Will an editor do this if this coding is a time-consuming (post-event) phase,
rather than integral to the process of developing the text for publication?
It seems to me that the very medium of electronic text prompts new insights and
approaches, and this is more exciting than electronic text merely as
conventional print-based text in another medium.  How can the academic
community benefit from the fruits of the labours of those who are not
algorithm-proficient in these respects? - i.e. the importance of the interface
again.

II. The Current Version of the Standards (TEI P1.1)

I would propose the following modifications to make them more
appropriate to the needs of scholars of literature (Please list in
descending order of preference):

(2)
1. A summary section of preceptive instructions for different text
types, i.e., a cook book with a set of rules with the minimally
acceptable tag set for a particular kind of text.
(3)
See F and G above.
(7)
In general I find them far too cumbersome for my own use.  I would
never have accepted them for the Dartmouth Project had they existed
back when we started.  They would have cost us lots of time and money
we do not have.  Agsin, it isd a question of what text is being pre-
pared for what user.  I can see the need for TEI, but hope TEI can see
that some of us, esp. those involved in free-standing data banks which
do not distribute text will want our own simple-as-possible mark-up.
(17)
Less emphasis on tagging, editorial intervention, etc. and more attention
to page and line references (absolutely necessary), page layout, etc.
(20)
1. basic forms of words
2. textual subdividions
3. titles of subdivisions
4. speakers in plays
5. correspondants and dates in epistolary fiction
(22)
1. Reproducing spacing if poetry on the page
(24)
1. Give  the editors  each a fat cigar and a blonde
2. And three weeks holiday in Mauritius
(28)
1.  improved treatment of drama, poetry, prose fiction
2.  more specialized treatment of special literary forms (e.g.
    particular genres of lyric)
3.  treatment of literary analysis:  narrative structure, themes,
    images, levels/types of discourse
(33)
1. Although metrical indications are important, it strikes me as both
        simpler and more important to provide ways of encoding the
        stanzaic structure of poems: right now there are provisions
        for indicating stanza breaks, indentation, and rhyme, but no
        way to indicate a pattern that combines these and is uniform
        throughout a poem.

2. The encoding for dramatic texts looks like it's on the right track;
        but it needs fuller examples, and either an illustration or
        a rethinking of <linejoin>---I don't see the reason for
        doing this as an empty element, rather than as a structural
        element within a line.
(37)
1.  I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with the standards.
2.  I wonder if there is a way to hide codes one doesn't need when
3.  working with a text.

Registering for ACH/ALLC '91: "MAKING CONNECTIONS"

Dear Colleague:

     I invite you to Tempe, Arizona, to attend ACH/ALLC '91, the
international conference that brings together members of the
Association for Humanities Computing and the Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing, March 17-21, 1991.

     March in Arizona is the "high" tourist season, so PLEASE
take note of the deadlines listed in the accompanying material.
The various discounts I have arranged require that arrangements
be finalized well in advance.  Once the blocks of rooms I have
reserved in the ASU dormitories and local hotels are fully
booked, you will have to pay substantially higher regular rates.
It may even be difficult to secure accommodations at all!

     You MUST register for the conference in order to stay in the
dormitories or to get the conference rate at the hotels.  Please
register, book your lodging and tour preferences, and reserve a
place at the banquet immediately.  Registration for the
conference, dormitory lodging, and the banquet, tours, and
workshop can be done by check in US dollars; or by VISA,
Mastercard, or American Express.  Please use the registration
form included with this mailing.

      The dress code for this conference is casual.  Hiking and
walking shoes are suitable for all occasions.  Bring bathing
suits and sunblock if you want to swim, sunbathe, or play tennis
or golf.  Although the weather is summery in Phoenix in March, if
you plan to go with us to the Grand Canyon after the conference,
you need to allow for cold weather.  Snow can still fall in the
Rockies in March.

I look forward to welcoming you to Arizona this March.

Best regards,

Comments:     Warning -- original Sender: tag was
From:         Elli Mylonas <elli%ikaros@HUSC6.BITNET>
Subject:      tagging question

I am tagging some texts that contain collections of fragments.
The fragments are grouped according to various categories, and
within each category, may be divided into speeches. (these
are fragments of the Attic Orators)
Each "speech" has a title, and may have 0 or more numbered
fragments.
ex:

A. Dicanic Speeches(These examples are made up...)
  1. Against Leocrates
    1. <fragment goes here>
    2. <another fragment goes here>

  2. Against Someone Else
    3. <yet another fragment>
    4. <...>

  3. [Against] another poor soul
    this one has no fragment, just a note on the source of this
    possible title (note the brackets in the title).  Usually
    we know titles from later juridical writers.

The problem is that different orators, because they had different
(usually German) 19th century editors, have different ways
of canonically numbering the fragments and their categories.

So, I can never assume the number of levels of heading that will lead
me down to the speech titles and/or to the fragment numbers. Because
there is also inevitably a group of unattributed fragments at the
end whose original speech is unknown.

My question is as follows:
is it better to create a set of numbered headings and to make
them optional?
  <!ELEMENT H1  --(H2? | FRAGMENT) >
  <!ELEMENT H2  --(H3? | FRAGMENT) >
  <!ELEMENT H3  --(H4? | FRAGMENT) >
  <!ELEMENT H4  --( FRAGMENT) >

So that a collection of fragments that does not have detailed heads
and subheads will only have H1 headings, followed by the actual
fragment (i am not describing the fragment element in all its
complexity...)

or is it better to have nesting H tags, with no indication of level?

  <!ELEMENT H  --(H | FRAGMENT )
  <!ATTRIBUTE H type   (1 | 2 | 3 | 4)  #required
               contents CDATA          #required  >

note that 1) the allowed numbers for the type of heading are listed
out explicitly, since we don't want a header 35 for ex.  This
attribute is not necessary, but might satisfy people who *need*
to have the level explicit.  the contents attribute is also
not necessary, the contents can be part of the contents of the element.

I rather like the second suggestion, since it allows me to handle any
number of headings for the fragments.  Also, it acknowledges the
fact that the categories are rather arbitrary.

Any comments?

btw, the same problem applies to the fragments of lyric, elegiac and
epic poetry.  There we have several layers of editor, starting with
the Alexandrians, creating categories.

Hello dear colleague:
quite a few people responded to my note on phonetic transcription.
Don`t expect too much. But you may see yourself below what the program (TRAN)
actually does. If you want to get it send a DOS-discette (5 1/4 or 3 1/2 inch)
or else $ 2 for a discette (which size?).
I would then copy it for you and return the discette.
An international mailing coupon for the return mail ($ 3 )
would be appreciated (or else add $ 3 in the letter).

For my own purpose TRAN`s transcriptions are sufficient.
I would like to get something similar for French. My respondents
don`t (yet) seem to know of such software. If you comme across
such a tool, please, let me know.
Best wishes

Subject:      elli mylonas's query - speaking as a user

(sound of removing editor's green eye-shade)

Elli Mylonas poses a nice clean question.  My first reaction, speaking
as a user, is that either approach is defensible, and neither will get
you into real deep trouble, beyond the obvious ones that EM's sample DTD
fragments need spaces between their tag-omissibility hyphens and a plus
or two at strategic points, thus:

  <!ELEMENT H1  - - (H2+ | FRAGMENT+) >

and

  <!ELEMENT H   - - (H+ | FRAGMENT+) >

The latter has, as EM points out, the advantage of being nestable to
arbitrary depths; this is, as she also points out, also its major
disadvantage, since one might wish to specify a maximum level.  EM
proposes a TYPE attribute to do this; that's the main argument against
EM's second formulation as it stands, since the attribute is (a)
redundant, since an application should be able to keep track of nesting,
and (b) possibly problematic, since it's hard to say what should be done
if the user specifies type=1 when actually the heading is four levels
down.

If you want explicit specification of the level (and you may, for
implementation reasons), I would certainly go with the first
formulation, since it allows the explicit specification to be validated.

The second formulation has the virtue of economy; it applies Occam's
Razor.  But it would be hard to process the way one usually wants to.  I
at least don't know any software that will track heading level and
provide different processing depending on level, except with a lot of
user work.  For what it's worth, that's the major reason (as I understand
it) that the TR committee of the TEI chose to leave Occam's razor
unapplied in this one area, and let the level be specified explicitly
in the tag name.
