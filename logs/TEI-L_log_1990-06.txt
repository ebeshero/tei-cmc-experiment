Publicity prose:

        Are you fed up with incompatible word processor formats?  Are you
        frustrated by the lack of interchangeability of the documents you
        painstakingly create?  Or do you have difficulties in creating an
        integrated database of documents in a multivendor environment?

        If so, "Practical SGML" is for you.  It shows how, by using SGML,
        you can interchange documents and process them on many different
        systems in many different ways.  SGML, the Standard Generalized
        Markup Language, is the ISO (International Standards Organization)
        standard for text representation.  The SGML format is independent
        of a particular text formatter of any kind of processing.  It is
        portable, structured, and readable, making it easier to create
        document databases.

        With the US Department of Defense and many computer manufacturers
        expressing their interest in SGML through the CALS (Computer-aided
        Acquisition and Logistics Support) initiative, this standard, and
        any application using it, is guaranteed a long and fruitful life.
        "Practical SGML" will help you make the most of it.

Dear Colleague:

From 27 May to 29 June 1990 I am out of the country and so gone from
this address, chiefly to attend the ALLC/ICCH conference in Siegen,
Germany.  Mail will be kept faithfully for me here, but if I do not
reply to your message in early July, please resend your message then.

The first fruits of the Text Encoding Initiative have put in an
appearance, at last. A preliminary version of the TEI Guidelines
for the encoding of machine readable texts was presented at recent
conferences in Pittsburgh (ACL) and in Siegen (ACH/ALLC) at the
start of June. A presentation about the Guidelines also attracted
much interest at the recent ICAME meeting in Berlin.

The text of this first draft of the Guidelines is currently being
finalised within the TEI committees, and will be published on July
15th. The draft will be distributed freely in order to solicit the
maximum feedback and comment within the community which the
Guidelines hope to address.

Over the next two years, we hope that the draft proposals in the
Guidelines will be refined, expanded, contradicted, revised, argued
over, quarrelled about, misunderstood, expounded, applied,
misapplied, enthused over -- anything except ignored. This bulletin
board, and others like it, will be used extensively for these
purposes, as will other more conventional means of publication and
scholarly dispute.

A further announcement will be made on this bulletin board as soon
as the draft is available.

Subject:      where is SGML being used

Is SGML actually being used anywhere on a large scale?  Is there soft-
ware based on it (i.e. academic, multilingual wordprocessors and text
bases)?  I'm just curious.

Subject:      in reply to goerwitz

Tempting though it is to reply to Richard Goerwitz' query (<q>is anyone
using SGML? what software exists?</q>)  "Gasp! rumbled at
last! all right governor, it's a fair cop - there's no such thing as
SGML software at all!!"  the facts of the matter are as follows:

1. SGML is very widely used and even more widely promoted outside the
academic community.

2. Software exists.

3. Eric van Herwijnen's `Practical SGML', recently published by
  Kluwers, is a very readable, informative and up to date summary
of activities in the SGML world.

4. Here (from memory) is a brief list of SGML parsing/validating software:

a. From Sema Group
        MarkIt
        WriteIt
b. From Software Exoterica
        XGML Validator
        XGML Normaliser
        XGML CheckMark
        XGML Translator
c. From SoftQuad:
        AuthorEditor
d. From IBM:
        DCF/SGML edition
        LEXX
e. From Open Texts Systems
        PAT
f. Academic projects
        TOLK (Turing Inst)
        DAPHNE (DFN)

However, one of the most interesting things about SGML is precisely that
you don't need special purpose software to use it. If you are dealing
with an existing correctly-tagged SGML document, then any old piece of
string handling software can be cobbled together to make sense of the
tags. If you can recognise tokens in an input stream and maintain a stack
then you can do it yourself!

Robin Cover (ZRCC1001@SMUVM1) has for many years been compiling
an exceptionally full and detailed bibliography of publications and
software relating to SGML. This is being worked on within one of the
committees of the TEI and is due for publication shortly.

Please accept the same questions from me also, potent partners in the
project don't guarantee success, remmeber e.g. ADA.
I hear in Germany courses are held about SGML, and several of the great
companies like Bosch, Siemens etc. change their publication standards to
SGML. Could one of the SGML initiates send me a short text file with
SGML commands? Is SGML only a sophisticated version of IBM's GML?
Many thanks for answers, I'm new to this list and hope this isn't
snow of yesteryear for all.
