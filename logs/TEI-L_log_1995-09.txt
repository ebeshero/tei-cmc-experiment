As chair of the TEI Steering Committee, I would like to heartily endorse
this idea and assure you that we in the TEI will do everything possible to
help you out in your efforts. Some of this information probably exists in
partial form in various places, but there is not, to my knowledge, a
comprehensive and up-to-date list available on the WWW. Apart from its
obvious value as a general information source, such a list would provide a
valuable resource for those considering using the TEI, including
information of the kind that can be used in proposal development etc. It
would also foster better communication among projects already using the
TEI.

I would encourage you to include substantial annotations and/or links from
your list to the projects included. Ideally, it would be great to provide
access to (even small) samples of the encoded data for each project as
well.

The TEI can in turn provide a link to your list from our home page on the WWW.

Many thanks for undertaking this project!

Subject:      SGML and presentation

I'd be grateful if someone could clarify just how one could go about
ensuring a particular document layout with SGML, should it
be a very important feature. I know its best to keep processing
instructions separately in a style sheet, but may I use a
silly awkward example to illustrate my query: a poem is laid out in
some kind of uneven spiral on one page, say, and uses a collection of
different fonts which can change in mid-verse or even mid-word, it
even uses a few lines of Chinese writing. This presentation is
considered an important part of the poem and it must be preserved.
Could a style sheet describe all this, or would it be considered
better to encode the presentational information within the document
itself? (or a bit of both) Would so much presentational information
severely retard the portablility of the document, and could it be
that SGML is simply not the ideal choice of markup for such a
scenario? Is there any way, encoding in SGML, that this
particularly awkward poet could ensure his poem was only viewed
in the layout he prescribed? Hope this doesn't seem like a silly
frivolous question, I know that SGML is meant for greater things
than denoting page layout, I'm just interested in whether it can do
this if it really has to.

cheers,
Karen Fraser.

I've newly signed up with the TEI discussion group. The welcome note
asks for planned or existing encoding projects - so here is my
interest...

I am an informatics contractor working for a library automation vendor.
They are planning an ambitious new library product which will manage all
library resources, not just books.These resources include local and
remote databases and catalogues.

They have a big investment in processing of MARC records but recognise
the limitations of this scheme for cataloguing anything other than books
(eg museum artefacts, serials, Web data etc.). The TEI offers the
possibility of a vehicle for cataloguing diverse resources.

As a start point, I would like to know what is in the pipeline regarding
the representation of MARC data in structured SGML format. MARC and
AACR2 rules are highly complex, virtually impenetrable for a
non-cataloguer. MARC fields show high dependence on each other which
suggestst there is an underlying structure waiting to be represented in
a better way - which may be SGML.

Some leading references/discussion threads pertaining to resource
discovery, metadata and MARC would be gratefully received.

Dear reader,

Peter Robinson writes in 'The transcription...' that DynaText is well suited
to browse TEI files. In my asumption, a TEI 'engine', or 'browser' for that
matter, would have to be able to process milestones, implement the extended
pointer syntax, check for valid attribute values, understand %inherited, be
able to check and implement the directions recorded in the WSD, and
represent elements such as <expan> well. Can anyone tell me if this is
covered in the DynaText browser? Which browser, if not DynaText, does all
this for us?

Thanks in advance,

Caveat for anyone new to the list: I *am* connected to DynaText, as its
system architect. I've worked with the TEI for even longer than DynaText
has been around, particularly on Text Representation, WSDs, and Hypermedia.

That said, I think Arjan has given a good set of requirements above, but
they cover a wide range of applications. For example, as a delivery engine
DynaText doesn't concern itself much with authoring issues, under which I
should think "check for valid attribute values" would fall.

I think it fair to say you will find no engine of any kind that will do
everything listed above well. DynaText, however, does quite a lot of this
off the shelf, and one could build much of the rest using our toolkit (a
possibility not even available with most products). Specifically:

* Process milestones: Depends, I suppose, on what "process" means. If you
mean find a milestone given its attributes, step a view through milestones
in either direction, count them, or display some kind of marker and
information at each milestone's location, that's all trivial off-the-shelf.
I did a little demo for the Women Writers' Project a couple years back
where you could read and search documents in DynaText, and each "page"
milestone also caused an icon to appear in the margin, which if clicked
brought up a scanned image of the same page you were reading; that worked
rather nicely, I thought.

* Implement the extended pointer syntax: the syntax from P1 has been
available in DynaText off-the-shelf for years. P3 is in the works but not
yet released. It can also be built with our toolkit, which gives complete
access to the tree structures and to all indexing information for content,
attributes, and GIs.

* check for valid attribute values: I would consider this an authoring-time
issue. However, if you want display-time checking you could rig it up in
the style sheet, for example to turn some element's content pink or slap up
a warning icon if some attribute doesn't have a value in a given list.

* understand %inherited: This could mean several things. At one level, any
SGML parser understands it since that's what it means to be a parser. At
the opposite extreme, of course no computer can 'understand' it at all. We
do have built-in provision for inheritance of attribute values, which may
be what you had in mind. For example, in a stylesheet you can not only
refer to attr(TYPE) to access the value of some named attribute of an
element, but inheritedattr(TYPE), which will look upwards through ancestors
until it finds the specified attribute. I think that's unique to us.

* able to check and implement the directions recorded in the WSD: Sorry, no
can do right now. However, the system supports a wide variety of Eastern
and Western writing systems, and you can select fonts and coded character
sets on the fly based on element types, the LANG attribute, etc, plus
specify character-> character mappings to reconcile your fonts with your
character sets.

* represent elements such as <expan> well: I suspect what you have in mind
is something like seeing either the expanded or the original form at will.
That same WWP demo I did a while back did something fundamentally similar
with a few lines of stylesheet magic: I think we were using <sic> and
<corr>: you could just pick the view you want and get either the original,
the correction, or both (with one bold and one struck-through or some
such).

Hope that's helpful. Oh, I can't resist mentioning that this will all work
portably across Mac, Windows, and most flavors of Unix.

Subject:      TEI & List Enumerators

A question about the way the TEI handles list enumerators:

I'm encoding a technical document where an item of the following
form appears:

<hi rend="typewriter">/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sc</hi>

After this, there is a list which explains the components of
this item.  The enumerators of this list are the letters
'c,' 't,' 'd,' and 's.'   The content of the list is easy to
encode:

<list>
<item n="c">The SCSI Host Bus Adapter</item>
<item n="t">The target ID on that bus</item>

and so forth.

However, this encoding misses the information that in this list
the enumerators 'c,' 't,' etc. are also highlighted in a typewriter-
style typeface.

I want to be able to say something like

<item n="<hi rend="typewriter">n</hi>">

but I'm sure this is absurd from an SGML point of view.

Any thoughts as to how I might encode this list?

The Synex ViewPort engine (used to implement SoftQuad Panorama)
supports a subset of the extended pointer syntax as described
by the grammar below. The links are interpreted directly from the
markup, without any additional scripting, as you read the SGML file.

I am not convinced of the benefits of a validating browser (though
our software makes a number of sanity checks); by the time a document
is browsed, it ought to have passed through an authoring and validating
stage, so why pay a performance penalty for full validation each and
every time you open and parse the document?

Hey!  I saw a fish in that barrel.  Pass me my shotgun...

But, seriously, a quick answer to the question is
ftp://lib.berkeley.edu/pub/sgml/marcdtd/usmarc.dtd, together with material in
the same directory, and its subdirectories.  I quickly found this by browsing
on the SGML Web site, http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html.    (While I'm here,
many thanks to Robin Cover and the Summer Institute of Linguistics for
maintaining this wonderful resource.)  Further browsing would probably throw up
further leads.  Suffice it to say that a considerable amount of work has been
done in the field.

Pausing only to remark that I'm not a librarian (making my cataloguing skills
roughly equal to my fish-shooting ability), I can say that the the TEI header
had interchange between headers and MARC records as a design goal.  A reading
of TEI P3, chapter 24 throws up frequent references to MARC.
http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-browse.sh?id=1938744 gets me straight to that
chapter today, but I don't know if the IDs remain constant: it's probably
better to go in at the top of the browser site, http://etext.v
irginia.edu/TEI.html.

I hope that's enough to get you started.

I can't speak about DynaText in this regard, but SoftQuad Panorama
can do some (I think most) of the extended pointer syntax, attributes and
parameter entities.  It does not use writing set definitions (WSD), and
I don't know about <expan> offhand.

There's a free version of SoftQuad Panorama you can download, which
includes TEI Lite (although we invented our own public identifiers, through
dire necessity! :-) ).  You would want Panoram PRO if you were working with
your own files, crating style sheets, etc., though.

As the originator of the remark that started this thread: I should explain
just why I said this.  Steve De Rose has already answered much of my
thinking much better than I could, so I'll just underline what I
particularly like about the TEI/Dynatext marriage.  It is this: TEI makes
extremely heavy use of attribute values to enrich the encoding
possibilities: every tag has by default four attributes (id lang rend
teiform) and many tags have many more: <expan> has four more, allowing you
to denote the unexpanded form of the text, the type of abbreviation here
expanded, how certain you are of the expansion and who did the expansion.
The "property value" functions in Dynatext are extremely good with
attribute values: you can replace the text of the expansion with the value
of the abbrev attribute in one "view", or have the text of the expansion
italicized or unitalicized in other views, etc.
Dynatext is also extremely good at permitting prescription of display by
document structure: it understands that when a <ref> is in a <list> you may
want it to do one thing; when it is in a <p> you want it to do something
else.  Further, you can determine different hypertext behaviours by
attribute value. The possibilities of control of text display for any one
element by a combination of the attributes of that element and its place in
the document hierarchy are endless. For example, the first Canterbury Tales
cdrom will have over one million hypertext links, most in the form of <ref>
elements (this will be a world record).  We want some of these links to
open new windows, sometimes containing only the text we are referring to,
sometimes containing the whole text scrolled to this point; some of the
links will not open a new window but scroll the text in that window; the
starting point of some links is indicated by an icon, for others by text
colour, for others by the cursor changing, for others by combinations of
these.  All this is done just by good ole <ptr> and <ref> (mostly <ref>;
one million refs later..), and reading its attributes and place in the doc
structure to determine appearance and hypertext behaviour.  This is really
pretty wonderful, and DynaText is, for this kind of heavy duty browsing, an
exceptional tool.  (of course, this capacity also extends to searches which
permit exactly the same kinds of searches on combinations of text,
attributes and structure).
One caution, however: if I read Arjan's message aright he is also asking
about DynaText's ability as a parser, as well as a browser.  It is a superb
browser.  But you have to be careful using the parser: it will pretty well
parse anything, and certainly does not give the kind of rich error
information you would get from sgml-s and (my favourite) YASP.  Especially,
it does NOT check id/idref pairings: it will happily let you parse
something with millions of idrefs to dis that don't exist and never
complain.  But there are lots of parsers that will do this for you, so
first run the text through one of them and then through DynaText.
and, of course, the next release of dynatext will be even better

Does anyone know:

Three dots often signifiy that certain parts of a sentence have been left

I have noticed that the three dots often come more closely together than
three "ordinary dots". Is there a TEI character entity for these three dots?

One solution to your problem would be to use the following encoding
(ignoring the fact that there may be other rendition text, such as a period
after the "c", "t", etc. that you may also want to preserve):

<list>
<item><label rend="typewriter">c</>The SCSI Host Bus Adapter</item>
<item><label rend="typewriter">t</>The target ID on that bus</item>

This encoding obeys a strict principle that we applied in the early stages
of  up translation from material originally in typesetter's formats etc. to
a first TEI encoding (I assume from what you say that you are doing up
translation from existing documents, and not creating the data): that all
data comprising the actual characters in the original printed text is
retained as tag content, and not shifted into attributes, etc. This enables
a clear distinction between what was in the original source vs. the markup
and other potential added information, and all original source data can be
treated in the same way (e.g. marked for rendition, as seems to be
necessary here).

Those three dots are called an ellipsis. The ISO entity name for that
character is "hellip", for horizontal ellipsis. Thus, the entity
reference you would use is "&hellip;" (assuming the core concrete
syntax :-).

Reference: ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Publishing//EN, typically
           called "isopub" or "isopub.ent".

I found lots of 'three dots' encoding
German prose. They occur at the beginning of
sentences, within sentences and in final position.
I couldn't find them in the punctuation chapter
of TEI P3.
Suggestion: entity in the punctuation chapter with
special regard to sentence initial, mid sentence and
sentence final position ?

Well, the TEI hasn't defined one, because the definition is already in one of
the public entity sets defined by ISO 8879, the SGML standard.  Specifically,
ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Publishing//EN says:

<!ENTITY hellip SDATA "[hellip]"--=ellipsis (horizontal)-->

The trick here is in knowing that the technical name for the three dots
"character" is "ellipses".

By the way, can somebody remind me which SGML textbook it is that contains a
list giving graphical representations of all the characters covered by the 8879
standard entity sets?  Thanks.

SGML character entities as given in annex D of the standard are not mandatory.

TEI? - I don't know. However, Bryan mentions among "Publishing
characters"

        &hellip;

meaning Horizontal ellipsis (three dots). It's part of an
Addison-Wesley Publishers public set of character entities.

You could do this, but a picture does more than a thousand words. In my
opinion, you should be clear on why you want to encode the poem in the first
place. If its's about the text, type the text. If it's about the image, scan
the image and pass it like that. If it's both, scan the image, type the
text, link the image to your document using NOTATIONs (i.e external
entities). The TEI recommendations are in ch. 22; check <figure>.
Now you only have the problem of specifying what part of the image aligns
with what part of the encoded text. This is also treated in ch. 22, page
636. Note that parts of HyTime are especially designed to do this. The
extended pointer syntax is much like the HyTime Finite Coordinate Space
addressing.

In short, no style sheet is designed to handle things like this. Note that
some image notations are also standardized.

It is not. An enormous amount of data is passed on through the ages for us
to both look at and read. SGML 'pure' encodes the information we think is in
there. Some information simply cannot be expressed in natural language or
symbols.

[... stuff deleted]

Presumably the fact that /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sc appears in a typewriter font is not
the most important thing about it. My guess is that you're more interested in
the fact that it is a filename of a particular sort, the components of which
are abbreviations that can be linked to the members of the list. Leaving that
aside just for the moment, I would think you'd get more mileage out of an
encoding the filename *as a filename*.

Using TEI P3 you would have to do this as
  <name type=filename>/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sc</name>
or
  <rs type=identifier>/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sc</rs>
as there is no specific element for these features in P3. Using TEI Lite, you
could use the element IDENT which is defined for exactly this purpose in that
dtd.

In either case, you could then leave it to the application to decide to format
identifer names in typewriter, or arial, or in red with a nice frame round them
or whatever. You could also write a neat application which would pick out all
the filenames and change them to some other format for when you have to migrate
the system being documented to some other platform.

Encoding the list could be done in a number of ways. The crucial decision is
what exactly you consider the enumerators to be. (All tagging questions are
ontological ones)

If they are simply enumerators, then you don't care what they look like and
your proposed use of the N attribute is appropriate.

If they are simply enumerators, but you do care what they look like, then you
should use the <label> element with or without a REND attribute, as Nancy Ide
suggests. (Note, by the way, that labelled lists can be organized either
<list type=gloss>
<label>c</label><item>The SCSI Host Bus Adapter</item>
<label>t</label><item>The target ID on that bus</item>
</list>
or
<list type=gloss>
<item><label>c</label>The SCSI Host Bus Adapter</item>
<item><label>t</label>The target ID on that bus</item>
</list>
This is one of several things I now consider suboptimal about the <list> tag)

If they are really abbreviations only incidentally being used as enumerators,
you could use the <abbr> element, either alone or within a <label>

<list type=gloss>
<item><label><abbr>c</abbr></label>The SCSI Host Bus Adapter</item>
<item><label><abbr>t</abbr></label>The target ID on that bus</item>
</list>

Finally, why not show that there's a link between the letter used as the label
and the letter in the filename? To do this we must be able to address both the
content of the <ident> element containing the filename, and the <label> element
in the <list>. A rather neat  way of doing this is to use the TEi extended
pointer syntax.

We start by adding <xptr> elements. Assuming that the <ident> element has been
given the identifier GRACKLE (i.e. it is tagged <ident
id=GRACKLE>/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sc</ident>) and we want to point at the "c" which is
its 11th character, here's one:

<xptr id=G11 from='id (GRACKLE) str(11,1)'>

Let's also add an <xptr> indicating the "C" used as a label identifier. We'll
assume this time that only the list has an identifier, say ZARNIEWHOOP. It
looks like this

<xptr id=Z2 from='id (ZARNIEWHOOP) child (1 item) child (1 label) child (1
abbr)'>

This might be read "the first <abbr> contained by a <label> which is the first
<label> contained by an <item>, which is the first <item> within an element
whose identifier is ZARNIEWHOOP". Relax, it's easier than reverse polish.

Now we want just to indicate that the thing that the <xptr> called Z2 is
pointing at, and the thing that the <xptr> called G11 are pointing at are to be
linked in some way. The element for doing this is called .... <link>, and looks
like this

<link targets='Z2 G11'>

Now to the big question. What can you do with it, now you've gone to all this
trouble? Well, an application can now very easily generate a hotlink, so that a
user can click on either the label of the list item,  or the letter of the
filename) to jump to the other. And you have made explicit to all and sundry
why on earth the first two items of your list are labelled C and T !

In need of a G and T,

Lou

My very diligent encoders have just brought me a problem which I am sorry
to say I am having a bit of difficulty in answering.

We are tagging, among other things, the Dumbarton Oaks Papers, the record
of the meetings held in San Francisco in 1945 for the purpose of forming
the United Nations.  One rather short document we have is entitled _Summary
of First Meeting of Coordination Committee_, under that line is another
which reads _Opera House, Room 418, May 9, 1945, 6:15 p.m._.  It is this
last which gives us a problem.

We are using a DTD with Prose as a base and have added in Linking and
Names-and-Dates.  I am not finding anything that really helps.  This looks
almost like stage directions, but this analogy doesn't lead me anywhere.
It's not an address in the postal sense.  It is somewhat similar to the
<meeting> tag found in bibliographical references, but it isn't a
bibliographical ref.  What am I missing?

By the way, it was brought to my attention that <placeName> may only occur
within <placeName>.  Has this been fixed?

TIA.

There is a TEIIPA entity set and wsd publicly available on the servers.
It is based on the 1989 IPA symbol set. John Esling of IPA and I drew them
up. There were a few more revisions decided in 1993 which we are working
on to issue a revision very soon. I am also working at the moment on a
mapping to the Adobe StoneIPA font which can be used within Explorer and
Panorama. I will make this publicly available as soon as it is ready. This
could be used by others to map the entities to their local IPA font if
they use another one.

The body which makes IPA decisions is the International Phonetic Association.
John Esling is its secretary. Their decisions are published in the
Journal of the IPA (JIPA). John and I wrote an article recently in it
on the IPA entity set.

On the ellipsis we did not include it because we assume all the ISO public
entity sets are available.

Hope this helps.

   Three dots often signifiy that certain parts of a sentence have been left
   out. In dictionaries, it is important to save as much space as possible, and
   I have noticed that the three dots often come more closely together than
   three "ordinary dots". Is there a TEI character entity for these three dots?

The three dots are called an ellipsis. There is no semantic
distinction between three dots printed close together and three
printed further apart: that is purely a typographic artifice (done as
you say in the cited instance to save space).

Normally if you type three periods, a wordprocessor or DTP system will
print them too close together: they require wider spacing to be
typographically acceptable in most house styles and are thus normally
handled as a single entity (for example, TeX's "\dots" macro, or the
related PostScript character found in some fonts).

The ISOpub character entity file has entities &hellip; and &vellip;
for horizontal and vertical ellipses.

 A parallel situation is described minutely in the paper below :

    study and text encoding, with examples from medieval texts
    (Literary and linguistic computing, 6-1, pp.34--46)

 The problem is, I take it, not the mechanism of linkage itself, but the way
 of conveying *meaning* implied in the linkage.

 Indentations are spaces at the head of lines, and here texts and images
 are linked. The <p> tags explicitly tell their meanings (significance), not
 the topological/graphical informations of the text in page.

 The <figure> tag for the Fraser cases tells no more than a simple linkage
 tag of "these spaces-at-head are linked to text here" tells, and may fall
 far short of what is aimed.

Greetings.

I'm sure this has been covered before, so I thank you for your patience.

What exactly is the problem with the persName element in the TEI names/
dates tag set? I've seen reference made to a 'bug' as well as line
I assume is intended to correct said bug.

As far as I can tell, persName *should* be available in any <P>-level
section of text, but a glitch somewhere forbids this (at least *I*
have been unable to use it--or orgName either). What do I need to fix,
and how does the fix work?

Thanks again--

Subject:      discussion list for technical matters

Every now and then the question comes up, "if I have a question using
the TEI encoding scheme, how do I get help?"  As many of you know, the
usual response, from those of us on the receiving end of this question,
is "Post the question to TEI-L."  Thanks to the generosity of many of
TEI-L's readers, questions on TEI-L almost always get prompt,
informative, correct answers, answers, whether they are about the TEI
proper, or how to make it work with a given software package.

On the other hand, every now and then one may have a problem which
is really rather technical, and may require an awful lot of back and
forth discussion which may be of only marginal interest for many
readers of TEI-L, who may not be vitally interested in the nuances
of SGML parsing and the like.  Many people are understandably shy
about burdening the inboxes of everyone subscribed to TEI-L with very
specialized queries --- and while I like to remind everyone that many
apparently specialized questions have very wide ramifications of very
general interest, nevertheless there *are* some topics that are of
restricted, rather than general, interest.

As many readers of this list know, there *is* a second TEI discussion
list, which is intended for the discussion of just such specialized
topics.  It is called TEI-TECH, and it provides a home for technical
(i.e. not necessarily general-interest) discussion of SGML and the TEI.
It hasn't received a lot of use lately, but I have been asked to remind
people that it exists, in part to ensure that those with technical
questions know there is a place they can direct them.  Syd Bauman of
the Women Writers Project has volunteered to start discussion by
posting a couple of meaty questions he's run up against.

To subscribe to TEI-TECH, follow normal listserv procedure:  send
mail to listserv@uicvm.uic.edu containing the single line

  subscribe tei-tech J. Doe

(substituting your name for 'J. Doe').

The TEI-TECH list is unmoderated, and open to the public.  I hope to
see many of you there.

We had a similar problem, and found that the most adequate (but still

I'd class this as a date line (or 'place-date line', as some call it)
and tag it DATELINE, assuming I could manage to get an OPENER element
around it, something like this:

<text>
<front><head>Summary of First Meeting of Coordination Committee</>
<opener>
<dateline>Opera House, August 16, 1945</></></front>
<body>
<p>The meeting began with ...
</body>
</text>

>By the way, it was brought to my attention that <placeName> may only

Yes.  Make sure your DTD files begin with comments saying they were
'written by OddDTD 1994-09-09'.

Firstly, do you need to do this at all?  If you have a browser which can
condition searches on SGML structure, and if you mark up sentences, you
probably don't need a distinct entity for each of the three cases: the browser
should be able to distinguish them:

beginning: sentence-start followed by ellipses
middle:  (anything but sentence-start) followed by ellipses followed by
  (anything but sentence-end)
end:  (ellipses followed by <sentence-end) or
  (ellipses followed by (sentence-end puntuation) followed by sentence-end)

But, if you do decide explicitly to distinguish the three cases in the
electronic text, by all means go ahead and define such entities , but give
careful consideration to their expansion.  A first cut at a TEI-ish way to
handle this situation might be

 <gap desc='&hellip;' extent='sentence start ellipses' resp=transcriber>
 <gap desc='&hellip;' extent='sentence middle ellipses' resp=transcriber>
 <gap desc='&hellip;' extent='sentence end ellipses' resp=transcriber>

as the expansions for the three entities.  Although purists can easily pick
holes in this idea:

  -- it hides the ellipses from the copy text as attribute values, obscuring
the
 fact that they appear in the copy text, and making it difficult for many
 browsers to display them
  -- desc is arguably misused in being used as a container for the ellipses
  -- extent should be used to say how much material was omitted, not where
 it has been omitted

A solution might be to use <del>:

 <del type='sentence start'>&hellip;</del>
 <del type='sentence middle>&hellip;</del>
 <del type='sentence end>&hellip;</del>

but then you begin to wonder about the value of the resp attribute: who is
responsible for this deletion?  I'd say the creator of the copy text.
Probably.  But others' ideas may differ.  What's more, if different hands can
be identified as being responsible for different ellipses, it's no longer
possible to use entities: you've got to insert the mark-up in full.  And, if
you wanted to add a commentary on the omission, you'd need a tag with an ID to
tie it to.  Again, you can't do this with an entity.

I'd say it's not the job of the TEI to define the three entities, firstly
because their expansion is dependent upon the aims of the transcriber, and
secondly because to define them might encourage their use in situations where
full-blown mark-up is really what is required.  But particular projects should
not shrink from defining such entities if entities can fill their needs.

Does anybody else feel like setting more angels dancing on this particular pin
head?

Thanks for the answer (the same one, so it must be right!) from Michael
S-McQ and Carole.  I agree that the solution is inadequate but gets the job
done for now.  It was the fact that <dateline> occurs only in <opener> or
<closer> that made me overlook it.

We are encoding a trilingual dictionary that consists of Basque

Note that the words "Fr" or "sp" do not appear in the text. The

the same problem with example sentences but which are given in the three

Dear Jon,

I would be happy to help on this topic, but I am not sure that I understand
completely the porblem(s). Could you please send me a few entries, so that
I can see the exact problem, and will send them back to you (and TEI-L)
encoded "a la" TEI (if I can!).

Thanks and best regards,
Jean

Subject:      TEI workshop

The Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative were published in 1994.
These have defined within the ISO Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML) for encoding many different text types. The Document Type
Definition (DTD) is modular and can be extended and modified. Tag sets
for prose, poetry, drama, dictionaries, hypertext linking, critical
editions, primary sources, and other documents are included. Linguistic
information encoding is also included as is provision for documents in
any language or languages.

SGML is also increasingly being used for hypertext/multimedia, in
particular in its HTML form, which is used on the World-Wide Web.

A Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) workshop will be held at Groningen
University in Groningen, The Netherlands on November 21 and 22.
The subjects will include an Introduction to SGML, SGML and HTML,
SGML Software, the public SGML DTDs, and TEI. In addition there will
be a hands-on session of TEI.

More information and a registration form is available on the web at
URL:http://www.let.rug.nl/~sgml95/.

The presenters will include Lou Burnard, Harold Short, Bert Bos,
Gerd v.d. Steen, and Harry Gaylord.

Information is also available by email from sgml95@let.rug.nl or
regular mail to TEI workshop, Dept. of Humanities Computing,
Groningen University, POB 716, NL 9700 AS Groningen, The Netherland.

Subject:      Call for Papers

I am reissuing this call for papers with an extended due date,
partly because I realized from the requests for extensions I
got that 4 Sept. is not a good time for a lot of people for
writing abstracts, partly because our mail system here crashed
sporadically, with massive destruction of mail, for several days
around that date.  Please, if you sent me something at that time
and did not get a response acknowledging receipt, either resend or
send an enquiry.  Abstracts received by the end of September will
now be on time; we will still need to have the electronic copy of
a completed paper (diskettes of most wordprocessor files are OK;
HTML or SGML sent over the net would be ideal; if in doubt about
format ask) by the beginning of November in order to do the
Web-mounting.

                         CALL FOR PAPERS

ASSOCIATION FOR LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING
ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES

JOINT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ALLC-ACH '96

JUNE 25-29, 1996 UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN, NORWAY

CALL FOR PAPERS

This conference -- the major forum for literary, linguistic and
humanities computing -- will highlight the development of new computing
methodologies for research and teaching in the humanities, the
development of significant new computer-based resources for humanities
research, especially focusing on developing applications.

TOPICS: The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing and the
Association for Computing and the Humanities invite submissions on
topics and applications focused on the humanities disciplines, such as:
languages and literature, history, philosophy, music, art, linguistics,
anthropology and archaeology, creative writing, cultural studies, etc.
We are interested in receiving technical proposals that focus on the
cutting edge issues of the application of scientific tools and
approaches to humanities disciplines; discipline-based proposals that
focus on some of the more traditionally defined applications of
computing in humanities disciplines, including text encoding, hypertext,
text corpora, computational lexicography, statistical models, and
syntactic, semantic, stylistic and other forms of text analysis; broad
library and research-based proposals that focus on significant issues of
text documentation and information retrieval; and tools-focused
proposals that offer innovative and substantial applications and uses
for humanities-based teaching and research, throughout the academic and
research worlds. Submissions on humanities computing in developing
countries and software/courses/courseware in undergraduate education are
welcomed.

The official language is English.

The deadline for submissions is 30 NOVEMBER 1995.

REQUIREMENTS: Proposals should describe substantial and original work.
Those that concentrate on the development of new computing methodologies
should make clear how the methodologies are applied to research and/or
teaching in the humanities, and should include some critical assessment
of the application of those methodologies in the humanities. Those that
concentrate on a particular application in the humanities (e.g., a study
of the style of an author) should cite traditional as well as
computer-based approaches to the problem and should include some
critical assessment of the computing methodologies used. All proposals
should include conclusions and references to important sources.

INDIVIDUAL PAPERS: Abstracts of 1500-2000 words should be submitted for
presentations of thirty minutes including questions.

SESSIONS: Proposals for sessions (90 minutes) are also invited. These
should take the form of either:

(a) Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word
statement describing the session topic, include abstracts of 1000-1500
words for each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to
participate in the session; or

(b) A panel of up to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an
abstract of 1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each
speaker is willing to participate in the session.

POSTERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS

ALLC-ACH '96 will include poster presentations and software and project
demonstrations (either stand-alone or in conjunction with poster
presentations) to give researchers an opportunity to present
late-breaking results, significant work in progress, well-defined
problems, or research that is best communicated in conversational mode.

By definition, poster presentations are less formal and more interactive
than a standard talk. Poster presenters will have the opportunity to
exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss their work in
detail with those most deeply interested in the same topic. Posters are
actually several large pieces of paper that present an overview of a
topic or a problem. Poster presenters are given space to display two or
three posters, and may provide handouts with examples or more detailed
information.

Poster presenters must be present at their posters at a specific time
during the conference to describe their work and answer questions, but
posters will remain displayed throughout the conference. Specific times
will also be assigned for software or project demonstrations. Further
information on poster presentations is available from the Program
Committee chair.

Posters proposals and software and project demonstrations will be
accepted until January 15, 1996 to provide an opportunity for submitting
very current work that need not be written up in a full paper. Poster or
software/project demonstration proposals should contain a 300 to 500
word abstract in the same format described below for paper proposals.
Proposals for software or project demonstrations should indicate the
type of hardware that would be required if the proposal is accepted.

Doctoral students are encouraged to consider poster submission as a
viable means for discussing ongoing dissertation research.

As part of its commitment to promote the development and application of
appropriate computing in humanities scholarship, the Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing  will award up to five bursaries of up
to 500 GB pounds each to students and young scholars who have papers
accepted for presentation at the conference.  Applicants must be members
of ALLC, and must be aged 30 years or less at the start of the
conference. Those wishing to be considered for an award should indicate
this in their conference proposal.  The ALLC will make the awards  after
the Programme Committee have decided which proposals are to be
accepted.  Recipients will be notified as soon as  possible thereafter.
A participant in a multi-author paper is eligible  for an award, but it
must be clear that s/he is contributing  substantially to the paper.

FORMAT OF SUBMISSIONS

Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged. Please pay particular
attention to the format given below. Submissions which do not conform to
this format will be returned to the authors for reformatting, or may not
be considered if they arrive very close to the deadline.

LOCATION

The University of Bergen was founded in 1946 but its history goes  back
to 1825 with the founding of the Bergen Museum.  The University has  an
enrolment of some 17,000 students. It is located in the central part of
the  city of Bergen. Hosting this conference, the  Norwegian  Computing
Centre  for  the Humanities was founded in 1972 and is located  at  the
University of Bergen.

Bergen, Norway's second largest city with a population of 220,000, was
founded in 1071 according to the sagas. The city was an important
Hanseatic trading centre and has retained an international profile that
dates back to the early Middle Ages.

There are direct flights to Bergen from Copenhagen, London, Oslo, and
Paris. There is also a train connection with Oslo, and a ferry between
Newcastle and Bergen.

Hotel rooms in different price ranges will be available within walking
distance from the conference center, and economically priced student
accommodation will be available outside central Bergen.

It is expected at this time that the fee for early registration for the
conference will be in the US$125 to US$150 range, with an additional
late registration fee.

Detailed information about the conference will be made available in
January or February of 1996.

Call for Participation

ACM DL'96 --- Digital
Libraries '96

First ACM International Conference on
Digital Libraries

Bethesda, MD
March 20-23, 1996

ACM Digital Libraries '96 is an international conference
devoted to advancing the state-of-the-art in digital
libraries.  The ACM DL series continues the sequence of
Texas conferences: DL'94 in College Station and DL'95 in
Austin.  The leaders of those events are helping with DL'96
organization and program efforts.  The meeting will be co-
located with Hypertext '96 in 1996 and with ACM SIGIR
'97 the following year.  DL '96 will immediately follow
Hypertext '96 at the Hyatt Regency
in Bethesda, Maryland.  The site is located near the
Washington D.C. Metro and provides easy access to the
many attractions in the Baltimore-Washington area.

The DL series is sponsored by ACM, through SIGIR and
SIGLINK.   Other ACM SIGs have joined in cooperation,
including: SIGAda, SIGART, SIGBIO, SIGCAPH,
SIGCOMM, SIGCUE, SIGDA,  SIGMIS (formerly SIGBIT),
and SIGOIS.

In-cooperation sponsors include:

ASIS (American Society for Information Science),
CNI (Coalition for Networked Information),
KSI (Knowledge Systems Inc.),
LITA (Library and Information Technology Association),
LoC (Library of Congress),
NAL (National Agricultural Library),
NLM (National Library of Medicine),
SLA (Special Libraries Association).

Three sessions at the conference have been reserved for the
working groups of the Digital Library Forum.  These
groups are studying aspects of interoperability in digital
libraries.  During the sessions, members of the groups will
describe the objectives of the groups, describe progress to
date, and lead discussions of the issues.  The exact list of
topics has not been finally chosen, but will likely include
open architectures for digital libraries, archiving and
digital preservation, and the National Computer Science
Technical Reports Library.



Technical Program

We seek papers, posters and videos on the one hand--and
proposals for tutorials and workshops on the other hand--
on topics related to Digital Libraries, including but not
limited to the following list:

* architectures, reference models, standards
* authoring and electronic publishing
* cataloging, indexing, preserving
* collaborative environments
* collecting, capturing, filtering
* distributed data, knowledge and information
representation and systems
* economic and social implications and issues
* education, learning and related applications
* evaluation methods and user testing
* handling of graphics, GIS, multimedia information
* hypertext and hypermedia systems (especially including
WWW) and support
* information storage and retrieval
* intellectual property rights
* modeling and simulation
* networked information discovery
* networking systems, protocols, security
* publisher plans and concerns
* user interfaces
* visualization, browsing, searching

Papers

Technical papers present original reports of innovative and
substantive new work that has not been published or
submitted for publication elsewhere.  Papers are refereed by
a pool of reviewers for the conference proceedings,
published by ACM.  Because of the tight time schedule,
designed to ensure that the latest results will be discussed,
there will be little time for revision, so submissions should
be in near-final form.

Important Dates:
Oct. 15, 1995 --- Papers due to Program Chair
Dec. 1, 1995 --- Authors notified about PC decisions
Jan. 1, 1996 --- Papers due to Program Chair

Submissions:  Papers must be written in English and
contain a maximum of 6000 words (excluding figures).  If
possible, use 10 point Times Roman, single-spaced, with
no more than a total of 12 pages.  The proceedings will be
printed in typical ACM 2-column format, and articles will
have a limit of 10 pages.  If submissions are made with
paper, 6 copies must be provided.  If submissions are made

Subject:      Re: Multi-lingual dictionary encoding issue

Jon Patrick <J.D.Patrick@massey.ac.nz> asked on TEI-L (Thu, 14 Sep 1995):

>We are encoding a trilingual dictionary that consists of Basque
>headwords and French and Spanish definitions, but not basque

Since then, Jon sent us a few entries of the Basque-Spanish-French
dictionary, about which he says:

>The fields are roughly basque, geographical-location,spanish,french..
>The files have scanned in so still contain spelling errors.

Here are a few suggestions, together with a few comments on some other
interesting problems we came across while looking throuh the materials.


1. Translations: in order to indicate the language for a given translation,
the global LANG attribute seems appropriate (note that we use <trans> and
not <def>, but see below):

[ Apama] , abuela,  grand'lnere.

<entry>
  <form>
    <orth>Apama</orth>
  </form>
  <trans lang=es>
    <tr>abuela</tr>
  </trans>
  <trans lang=fr>
    <tr>grand'lnere</tr>
  </trans>
</entry>


[ Aphalmentu]  (S), Ahaiamiclllo:  abaisselrzent,  humiliation .

<entry>
  <form>
    <orth>Aphalmentu</orth>
  </form>
  <usg type=geo>S</usg>
  <trans lang=es>
    <tr>Ahaiamiclllo</tr>
  </trans>
  <trans lang=fr>
    <tr>abaisselrzent</tr>
    <tr>humiliation</tr>
  </trans>
</entry>



2. Examples: The LANG attribute can also be used here:

[ APARATSU]  ( AN - b ), apero, con-junto de instrumentos y herramientos de
un oficio:  attirail, I'ensemble des outils d un mThetatier.  NEKAZALGO
APARATSUAK, los aperos de la branza, les instruments aratoires.  (??)

<entry>
  <form>
    <orth>APARATSU</orth>
    <usg type=geo>AN - b</usg>
  </form>
  <sense>
    <def>apero,con-junto de instrumentos y herramientos de un oficio</def>
    <def>attirail,I'ensemble des outils d un mThetatier</def>
    <eg>
      <q>NEKAZALGO APARATSUAK</q>
      <trans lang=es>
        <tr>los aperos de labranza</tr>
      </trans>
      <trans lang=fr>
        <tr>les instruments aratoires</tr>
      </trans>
      <xr>??</xr>
    </eg>
  </sense>
</entry>



3. Usage notes: In the "Aphalmentu" example above, the headword seems to be
restricted to use in a single geographic area. However, in the the example
below, there are different orthographic forms of the word for different
geographical regions. In the first case, we placed the <usg> tag at the
entry level, whereas below the different geographical usage notes are
placed within the <form> tag in order to associate them with the
appropriate orthographic variant.

[ Apal-ordu]  (B, G), [ aihal-tenore]  (Sc), hora de cenar,  heure de souper.

<entry>
  <form>
    <orth>Apal-ordu</orth>
    <usg type=geo>B</usg>
    <usg type=geo>G</usg>
  </form>
  <form>
    <orth>aihal-tenore</orth>
    <usg type=geo>Sc</usg>
  </form>
  <trans lang=es>
    <tr>hora de cenar</tr>
  </trans>
  <trans lang=fr>
    <tr>heure de souper</tr>
  </trans>
</entry>


In this example, the usage note applies to different senses of the word,
for which there is only one orthographic form. So, here <usg> is included
within the appropriate <sense> tags:


[ Apaloste] : 1o (BC), despues de cenar,  apr s souper.--   2o (B), trabajo
r#stico que despues de cenar se hace enltre varios vecinos,  travail
rustique que font apres souper divers voisins rThetaunis.


<entry>

  <form>
    <orth>Apaloste</orth>
  </form>

  <sense n='1o'>
    <usg type=geo>BC</usg>
    <trans lang=es>
      <tr>despues de cenar</tr>
    </trans>
    <trans lang=fr>
      <tr>apr s souper</tr>
    </trans>
  </sense>

  <sense n='2o'>
    <usg type=geo>B</usg>
    <trans lang=es>
      <tr>trabajo r#stico que despues de cenar se hace enltre varios
          vecinos</tr>
    </trans>
    <trans lang=fr>
      <tr>travail rustique que font apres souper divers voisins
          rThetaunis</tr>
    </trans>
  </sense>

</entry>


4. Translation or definition?

Some of the examples that Jon sent, such as the "Apaloste" example above,
do not give a simple translation, but instead provide an explanation of the
meaning of the headword. This is a common situation in bi-lingual and
multi-lingual dictionaries, when there is no exact translation equivalent.
Occasionally, these dictionaries provide both a translation and a lengthier
explanation (see section 12.3.3.2 in P3, page 344 in the printed version).

This problem was discussed at aome length in the dictionary working group,
because the line where translation stops and definition begins is not at
all clear. Our solution was to allow two tags in side <trans>: a <tr> tag
for translations, and the <def> tag for definitions. It is up to the
encoder to decide where the distinction lies. If the lengthy explanations
in the "Apaloste" example are regarded as definitions, the encoding would
be:

<entry>

  <form>
    <orth>Apaloste</orth>
  </form>

  <sense n='1o'>
    <usg type=geo>BC</usg>
    <trans lang=es>
      <tr>despues de cenar</tr>
    </trans>
    <trans lang=fr>
      <tr>apr s souper</tr>
    </trans>
  </sense>

  <sense n='2o'>
    <usg type=geo>B</usg>
    <trans lang=es>
      <def>trabajo r#stico que despues de cenar se hace enltre varios
           vecinos</def>
    </trans>
    <trans lang=fr>
      <def>travail rustique que font apres souper divers voisins
           rThetaunis</def>
    </trans>
  </sense>

</entry>



We hope this helps.

From:         Jean Veronis <veronis@univ-aix.fr>
Subject:      Morph info in dict entries

In a private note, Eric Peterson <eric@azrael.mitre.org> asked me some
clarification about the encoding of morphological information in dictionary
entries. I have the feeling that we did not explain this very well in the
Guidelines, and I am posting here (with Eric's authorization) a summary of
our discussion, which might be of interest to other people.

Eric was trying to find a legal way to note that an unusual <orth> form is
peculiar to a particular part of speech - but not to all inflections of
that POS, as in the following example (from a French-English dictionary):

________________________________________________________________________
bonhomme
  nm: (pl bonshommes) fellow
  a: good-natured;
________________________________________________________________________


The headword information ("bonhomme") applies to two senses, and the first
sense has an unusual plural form ("bonshommes"). The following encoding,
suggested as a possibility by Eric, reflects correctly the structure of the
entry:

  <entry>

    <form>
      <orth>bonhomme</orth>
    </form>

    <sense>
      <gramGrp>
        <pos>n</pos>
        <gen>m</gen>
      </gramGrp>
      <form type=infl>
         <number>pl</number>
         <orth>bonshommes</orth>
      </form>
      <trans>
        <tr>fellow</tr>
      </trans>
    </sense>

    <sense>
      <gramgrp>
        <pos>a</pos>
      </gramgrp>
      <trans>
        <tr>good-natured</tr>
      </trans>
    </sense>

  </entry>

However, Eric said that this encoding seems to suggest that the whole noun
sense must be plural. This is the part that we did not explain very well in
P3.

You probably noticed that both <form> and <gramGrp> can contain the
morphological tags <gen>, <number>, etc.. However,

- the <gramGrp> tag gives grammatical info about the sense in which it appears
  (or the whole entry if it appear at the top level);

- the <form> tag gives information only about one or several forms for a given
  sense (or the whole entry), and the morphological tags that appear in it give
  morphological information only about that or those forms only.

If I wanted to represent the fact that the first sense is only plural
(which is not the case in the example), I would do:

  <entry>

    <form>
      <orth>bonhomme</orth>
    </form>

    <sense>
      <gramGrp>
        <pos>n</pos>
        <gen>m</gen>
        <number>pl</number>
      </gramGrp>
      <form>
         <orth>bonshommes</orth>
      </form>
      <trans>
        <tr>fellow</tr>
      </trans>
    </sense>

    <sense>
      <gramGrp>
        <pos>a</pos>
      </gramGrp>
      <trans>
        <tr>good natured</tr>
      </trans>
    </sense>

  </entry>

It is interesting to see how other have approached the setup of their Panorama
files, at Oxford we have taken a slightly different approach and made use of
public identifiers at the beginning of the document, for example:

<!DOCTYPE TEI.2 PUBLIC "-//TEI//DTD TEI Lite 1.0//EN">

while at the same time making the appropraite declarations in the CATALOG and
ENTITYRC files.

>and change the <>entityrc<> file to  contain something like:
>
>PUBLIC "-//LMB//TEI.2 SYSTEM//EN"

here we have made declarations in the ENTITYRC file using STYLESPEC, NAVIGATOR
and VERBATIM to define which stylesheet, navigator or verbatim text is to be
used by the application. By doing this you are not prompted by Panorama for a
stylesheet of navigator everytime you load a text.
e.g

PUBLIC "-//TEI//TEI lite 1.0//EN"
VERBATIM "EG"
STYLESPEC "Default" "TEILITE.SSH"
NAVIGATOR "Default" "TEILITE.NAV"

Consider using the terminological interchange format TIF from P3.  If I
remember correctly, it will allow you to encode a language code (among other
things) within a def field.

Why are you using TEI for this purpose?

In any event, it sounds as though your list needs labels.  From
teicore2.dtd:

<!ELEMENT %n.list;      - -  ((%n.head)?, ( ((%n.item)+) |
                             ((%n.headLabel)?, (%n.headItem)?,
                             (%n.label;, %n.item;)+)))          >

Though I don't use TEI very much, I'd think that your enumerators
go in labels as content, which you can mark up.  This would be like
a DL in HTML, or a Variablelist in Docbook.

Subject:      Encyclopedia Marked Up in TEI-compliant SGML?

I direct the Metaphysics Research Lab at the Center for the
Study of Language and Information (CSLI) on the Stanford
University campus.  CSLI is an interdisciplinary research
institute, with academic philosophers, logicians, linguists,
computer scientists, etc., collaborating on various problems
connected with the way inwhich people and computers use
language and process information.

  We are starting a project of creating an on-line Encyclopedia
of Philosophy, to be served over the Web.  Our idea is to give
experts in the field an SGML template to fill out: we provide
the tags and they provide the content.  Then we will give them
an account on our server and write permission to the directory
storing the data for their particular entry.  That way, they
can update and maintain their entry directly.  So the
encyclopedia should not go out of date and will simply continue
to grow.  Moreover, we don't want there to be a single way to
view the encyclopedia (for example, by clicking a button, the
user should get either a dictionary-style (short) entry or the
longer encyclopedia entry).  So we want to be able to generate
HTML on the fly in such a way that tailors the HTML pages to
the research interests of the user.

  My question is: what resources are their in the TEI tag
scheme for encyclopedias.  I have looked at the tei2.dtd, and
have looked at teidict2.dtd, and the teilite.dtd.  But none of
these definitions offer tags uniquely tailored to marking up an
encyclopedia.  Did I miss something?  Should we construct our
own DTD by extending the TEI set?  Can someone point me to an
encyclopedia that has already been marked up in TEI compliant
SGML?
  Thanks for any tips and pointers.

Subject:      Encoding Question: div Element

I am using TEI Lite for transcribing and marking up an early 19th century
work of systematic theology. The author is driving me crazy with
inconsistent use of divisions and division markers. In one case a series
of logical divisions just sort of peters out, and the last two are not
even full paragraphs, but just parts of paragraphs. I am using the id
attribute to give a unique id to each div element and the n attribute to
show the divison markings in the text. What I need to know is whether the
following is legal TEI Lite. Can a <p> element contain multiple (or any)
<div> elements? Also, regarding the hymn lines at the end. I get mixed
messages from the simplistic parsers I use. Can a <p> element contain
multiple <l> elements?

<div1>
. . . .

<div2>
. . . .

<div3 id="pop1229" n="i)">
<p>The peculiar structure of Christianity by which it
accomplishes the benign effects above enumerated, and which adapt
it to universal adoption under every form of civil government,
and every state of social society, demonstrate that it is based
on a more perfect view of all the complicated relations of human
society and all the principles of human nature than ever fell to
the lot of any uninspired teacher of religion.</p>
</div3>
<p>Similar evidences are found in <div3 id="pop1229y" n="j)"> the
mythologies of the Asiatic nations, which confirm many of the
prominent facts of the Old Testament:</div3> <div3 id="pop1229z"
n="k)"> in the discoveries of modern geologists, who find in the
bowels of the earth conclusive proof of a universal deluge, of
antediluvian animals, &amp;c. &amp;c.</div3></p>
<p>In view of this overwhelming mass of concurrent evidence, to
which might be added the corroborative testimony of profane
writers, of coins, of geology, &amp;c., it is impossible for the
impartial and persevering inquirer to doubt the divinity of the
Christian religion. To suppose all these evidences to have
originated in chance, is to admit a far greater miracle than any
contended for by the Christian, and to believe it performed
without any design, performed too without any beneficial effect,
yea performed in circumstances calculated inevitably to involve
the human family in a stupendous system of unqualified error! The
different objections against Christianity are either mere
misapprehensions of the objector, or they can be, as they often
have been, satisfactorily answered. How truly may it, then, be
said of the Christian, <q>on argument his faith is built.</q> How
just the declaration,
<l>A Christian dwells, like Uriel, in the sun,</l>
<l>Meridian evidence puts doubt to flight;</l>
<l>And ardent hope anticipates the skies.</l></p>

                    Universitaet Tuebingen
=====================================================================


Was ist die TEI?
----------------
Die Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), ein gemeinsames Unternehmen der
Association for Computers and the Humanities, der Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing und der Association for
Computational Linguistics, hat seit 1987 Richtlinien fuer die
elektronische Textauszeichnung und den Textaustausch erarbeitet. Das
Ergebnis, 1994 als Buch und CD veroeffentlicht, ist die Bereitstellung
und Erlaeuterung SGML-konformer Document Type Definitions, die modular
aufgebaut ein grosses Instrumentarium an Auszeichnungen fuer die
Wiedergabe verschiedener Textsorten (Prosa, Poesie, Drama, Lexika
etc.) und verschiedener Arten der Textuntersuchung (Textkritik,
Textvergleich, linguistische Analysen, Querverbindungen etc.) bieten.


Was sind die Themen des Workshops?
----------------------------------
Unter anderem sind folgende Themen vorgesehen:
- Einfuehrung in Idee und Regeln von SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
Language, ISO-Norm 8879 von 1986)
- Klaerung des Verhaeltnisses von SGML, TEI und HTML (im World Wide
Web verwendete Hyper Text Markup Language)
- Wissenschaftliche Aspekte des Einsatzes der TEI-Auszeichnungen
(Dokumentenanalyse, heuristische und hermeneutische Implikationen)
- Einsatzgebiet und Ziele der  TEI-Verwendung: Datenaustausch,
vielfaeltige Verwendung der Dokumente, TEI als gemeinsame Plattform
von verschiedenen Bearbeitungsgaengen in Projekten (TEI-Dokumente als
Endprodukt und als Datenformat fuer die Erarbeitung)
- Vorstellung und Demonstration verschiedener Software zur Erfassung,
Pruefung und Weiterverarbeitung (Durchsuchen, Erstellung von Indizes,
Druckausgabe, elektronisches Publizieren) von SGML Dokumenten


An wen wendet sich dieser Workshop?
-----------------------------------
Der Workshop wendet sich an alle, die auf dem Gebiet der
Geisteswissenschaften mit der elektronischen Erfassung, Bearbeitung,
Edition und Veroeffentlichung von Textdaten beschaeftigt sind: die
Quellen sammeln, dokumentieren, mit Informationen anreichern, die
Analysen an Texten durchfuehren, die lexikographische Datenbanken
erstellen, bibliographische Daten sammeln, die Texte kritisch neu
erarbeiten, die elektronische Textdaten mit anderen austauschen, auf
verschiedenen Medien (Netz, CD-ROM, Buch) veroeffentlichen.


Wer veranstaltet den Workshop?
------------------------------
Der TEI-Workshop wird vom Zentrum fuer Datenverarbeitung der
Universitaet Tuebingen durchgefuehrt, das seit vielen Jahren um die
Unterstuetzung von EDV-Anwendungen in den Geisteswissenschaften
bemueht ist. Als eine der ersten Universitaeten hat Tuebingen vor 25
Jahren in seinem Zentrum fuer Datenverarbeitung eine eigene Abteilung
fuer Literarische und Dokumentarische Datenverarbeitung eingerichtet,
in der man sich mit den Problemen der computerunterstuetzten
geisteswissenschaftlichen Textdatenverarbeitung beschaeftigt. Das
bekannteste Produkt dieser Arbeit ist das Software-Paket TUSTEP, das
Grundoperationen zur Textdatenverarbeitung zur Verfuegung stellt.


Wer sind die Referenten?
------------------------
Michael Sperberg-McQueen PhD (Germanistik) vom Computer Center der
Universitaet von Illinois in Chicago (USA) ist seit 1987 mit der TEI
befasst. Er war massgebliches Mitglied im Leitungsteam fuer die
Erarbeitung der Richtlinien und als Koeditor fuer die
Veroeffentlichung der Richtlinien verantwortlich. Er gilt mit Recht
als einer der Vaeter der TEI und ist einer der fuehrenden Spezialisten
fuer die SGML-konforme Auszeichnung von Texten in den
Geisteswissenschaften.

Dr. theol. Winfried Bader vom Zentrum fuer Datenverarbeitung der
Universitaet Tuebingen hat durch seine langjaehrige

It looks to me as if at least part of what you have coded as a <div3> might
better be coded as an <item> in an ordered <list>.  <item>s can contain
either <p>s or #PCDATA, so it doesn't matter if some of the <item>s are not
full paragraphs.

>Can a <p> element contain multiple (or any)
><div> elements?

No, but if you use a <list> (see above), this problem goes away.

Not directly.  Isn't this verse a quote as well? <l>s can occur within a
<q>, which can occur within <p>.

Hope this helps.

I couldn't agree more. We made a bid to the EU for funding to do precisely
that, but although short-listed it seems to have fallen on stony ground. We are
reliant therefore on the willingness of other European organizations or
institutions to fund such activities, and we hope that lots of others will
follow Tuebingen's example. In fairness though, I should point out that this is
not the first non-anglophone TEI presentation -- I gave one in (more or less)
French this past summer at the AIS Summer School, and I am sure there have been
many others I don't know about.

As regards translations of TEI publications, may I take this opportunity to
urge more interested parties to follow the example of the French Ministry of
Education, which has recently commissioned a French translation of the TEI Lite
Tutorial (TEIU5)? I also know that a Spanish translation of P2, and an Italian
version of P2, have both been produced (at the Universities of Barcelona and
Pisa respectively) but I don't know how widely available they are.

We'd love to see a Polyglot's Corner on the TEI Web Page! If you're interested,
let us know.

              READING AND PUBLISHING

A friend forwarded this to me.  Goodness knows how it reached him,
although it lost its header along the way.  Anyway, I thought that there
must be somebody on this list who feels that they have enough to tell a
group such as the SOCIETY FOR THE HISTORY OF AUTHORSHIP, READING AND
PUBLISHING about how SGML in general and the TEI recommendations in
particular can help them that they'd want to submit an proposal.  On a
note no doubt out of keeping with the gravity of the conference, I love
"Although submissions by e-mail and fax will be accepted, original hard
copy is *greatly* preferred."  I guess this reflects an inchoate concern
about the big electronic bugaboo which is going to erase all traces of
authority from documents.  Perhaps someone can reassure them.  Or at
least show how the mighty sword of the TEI and impregnable armour of
SGML can help them fight back.

CALL FOR PAPERS:

SOCIETY FOR THE HISTORY OF AUTHORSHIP, READING AND PUBLISHING

FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE

WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS, 18-21 JULY 1996

        The fourth annual conference of the Society for the History of
Authorship, Reading and Publishing will meet 18-21 July 1996 in
Worcester, Massachusetts, under the auspices of the American Antiquarian
Society and its Program in the History of the Book in American Culture.
SHARP welcomes proposals for papers dealing with the creation,
diffusion, or reception of the written or printed word in any historical
period.  Conference proceedings will be in English, but papers may deal
with any national literature.  There are no limitations on topics, but
we may organize special panels on comparative histories of the book; the
book in the Americas; the collection and description of archival
material and statistical information on printing, publishing, and
reading; and future agendas for the field.

        Submissions are encouraged from academics, graduate students,
librarians, professionals in the book trades, and others with a special
angle of vision on the field.  Proposals for either individual papers or
full panels may be submitted.

        Proposals (one pages maximum) and inquiries about the conference
itself should be sent to: SHARP 1996, American Antiquarian Society, 185
Salisbury Street, Worcester, MA 01609-1634 USA, fax 508-754-9069, e-mail
cfs@mark.mwa.org.  Although submissions by e-mail and fax will be
accepted, original hard copy is *greatly* preferred.  The deadline for
submission of proposals is 20 November 1995.  For information about AAS
and its Program in the History of the Book in American Culture, contact
John B. Hench, the Society's director of research and publication, or
Caroline F. Sloat, as above.

        SHARP is an international organization of book historians.
Membership--which includes a subscription to the SHARP quarterly
newsletter and annual membership directory--is $15 in the United States
and Canada, L10 in Britain, $20 elsewhere.  Checks in American or
British currency, made out to SHARP, should be sent to the Membership

The TEI tagset for dictionaries is the closest to what you are looking for,
but it was not intended to cover encyclopedias. The dictionary tag set
includes a few tags that might be of use to you (e.g., <xr> and possibly
<re>). You should have a look at the dictionary chapter, and probably the
one on terminology as well, since there are likely to be some ideas and
tags in these chapters that you can use.

It seems to me that many of your needs can be met by the TEI tags for
general prose. You can always use the TEI <div> or <divN> tags to mark
structural divisions in your encyclopedia, and a <head> tag could be used
for the entry keyword in the appropriate <div>. The TEI tags for general
prose and bibliographic citations should handle the entry text adequately.

The other option is to extend the TEI DTD to handle your encyclopedia. This
would be preferable if you want or need to restrict the allowed contents of
each entry (for validation purposes, for example); relying on the existing
TEI DTDs provides little restriction, since simply because they are
general, tags such as <div> allow great freedom in what can appear inside
them, and where. And if you can identify some consistent and coherent
structural principles common across encyclopedias and capture them in your
DTD, your work could provide a document model for encyclopedias that would
be useful for others. (As with our experience in developing a DTD for
dictionaries, I suspect the attempt to provide a general model for
encyclopedia entries itself would be very illuminating!) I am not sure how
highly structured encyclopedia entries are, or how much they differ from
general prose, so I am not sure that developing a special DTD is worth the
effort. However, should you decide to go this route, those of us who worked
on the dictionary DTD would be very interested to follow your efforts and
help out in any way we can.

Not to mention a Japanese translation of portions of P3, produced at
Chiba University for use in the Chiba Map Task Corpus project (which
replicates, in Japanese, the kind of task-oriented spoken corpus,
produced in a controlled environment, originally created (I believe)
by Henry Thompson in English).

As with the Spanish and Italian translations, I don't know how
widely available the Japanese materials are.

 I would strongly like to be informed of the project by Chiba University.

 I am especially interested in the technique of writing TEI-comformant
 documents with its "writing system declaration".

 I wonder how it is possible to code documtents with multi-byte coded
 character set (like Japanese JIS X0208) mixed with single-byte ones
 into SGML without violating the standard, which clearly states that
 the code set is "a set of bit combinations of *EQUAL SIZE*" (4.43)...

The Victorian Women Writers Project is an electronic collection
of texts by British women writers of the late Victorian period.
The collection includes works by Louisa Bevington, Amy Levy,
Eliza Keary, Maud Keary and Dollie Radford, with works by
Mathilde Blind, Dinah Maria Mulock Craik and Louise Guiney in
preparation. Currently, the collection includes volumes of poetry
and verse drama, with plans to include other literary and
critical texts in the future. Considerable attention will be
given to the accuracy and completeness of the texts, and to
accurate bibliographical descriptions of them. The etexts are
available as HTML documents or as TEI documents either for
downloading or use with Panorama Free. The Victorian Women Writers
Project is supported by Indiana University's Library Electronic
Text Resource Service (LETRS) and is available for use through
