Subject:      Information on SGML parser

In December, 1989 I have received through this list
the information that MARK-IT software can be obtained,
if used for research. I have sent to Yard Software System
the signed contract and everything thay asked for but
I have received no answer. Does anyone know what happened?

Maybe somebody connected to this list knows for some
other SGML parser for IBM PC XT/AT/386 that could be
obtained. It would be strictly used for the research,
namely for the construction of the pilot Serbo-Croatian
corpus marked up usin SGML.

As this list is till now my only conection with the
SGML users, I would be very important for any information.

Subject:      New product announcement from Sema

Sema Group recently announced a new structured document editor for SGML.
Called WriteIt, the product operates either as a smart SGML editor,
as a word processor or as a friendly user interface to version 3 of MarkIt
(not yet released). I saw the product briefly demonstrated by Martin Bryan
(its author) yesterday and was quite impressed.

===============
The blurb says:
===============
 When using WriteIt as an SGML smart editor, the
author selects a compiled DTD, which then allows documents to be viewed
as structured documents. The documents can be "browsed" from node to
node of the structure. Whether creating a new document or editing an
existing document, menu bars show the cursor's location within the tree
structure of the document and the permissible tags at that point.

Tags are inserted by selection from the menu. The structure is validated
interactively, so selecting a tag automatically results in a new series
of tag options being presented. This allows local enrichment of the
structure by the use of optional or repeatable elements. WriteIt
supports tag minimisation (such as ShortTag) on loading an existing
document, and Omit tag interactively.

The user interface includes windowing, optional mouse and pull down
menus including extensive Help screens. A comprehensive range of word
processing functions are provided in addition to the SGML
capabilities. Editing functions include cut and paste between
windows with automatic revalidation of the structure. To minimize the
risk of tag errors, cuts containing nest elements must include both
start and end tags for all nested elements within the cut.

WriteIt is available for DOS pcs  and requires a minimum of 640K of
memory. Versions for MS-Windows and UNIX will be available later in
1990.

No pricing information is available yet.

Subject:      MarkIt License Update

I have received a letter from Yard Software to the effect that copies of
MarkIt (version 2.2) are on their way to the following lucky subscribers
to this list:-

  David Stuebler (Montclair); Terry Butler (Alberta); Karel Babcicky (Oslo);
  Andrea de Leeuw van Weenen (Leiden); Axel Wupper (Bonn); David Birnbaum
  (Harvard); Stig Johansson (Oslo); Hans van Halteren (Nijmegen); Brad
  Inwood (Toronto); Charles Faulhaber (Berkeley); C M Sperberg-McQueen
  (Chicago); Yair Orgler (Tel Aviv); PMCvan Dijck (Amsterdam); John
  Bradley (Toronto); Jagos Puric (Belgrade)

If your name doesnt appear on this list and you think you've gone through
the required hoops (i.e. sent the signed license form together with a
request on the headed notepaper of your institution), don't hesitate to
badger Yard Software Systems! The address is

  Geoffrey Gudgion, Yard Software Systems Ltd, Avonbridge House,
  Bath Road, Chippenham SN15 2BB     fax +44 (249) 655723

It occurs to me that this list might be a good way for users of MarkIt
to share impressions, expertise, tips etc. and generally act as a mutual
support group. I have fairly good links with the company and will willingly
act as an intermediary if there is general interest in this possibility.
